# Week One

In the first week, I'd like to get to know the Design, Engineering and Technical Program managers who I'll be working with most often.

The rest of that week, I'd focus on learning as much as possible about the company, revenue market, competitive landscape, and the product I'll be working on, to ensure I have a full picture of where the product currently sits versus where it needs to go.

I'll also take time to use the product daily, to spot bugs and areas for improvement.

# Week Two

In the second week, I'd focus on reaching out to the Sales, Research and Support team leads to gain a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of the product as it currently stands with customers and internal metrics.

I'd also try to sit in on any experiments or user tests being conducted, to have a better understanding of our customers first-hand.

# Weeks Three and Four

In the following weeks, I'd like to schedule more in-depth meetings with the design and engineering teams, to get to know non-manager employees and hear their direct thoughts on the product roadmap.

I'll focus on integrating all the information compiled through research and discussions with employees & customers in one place, to spot patterns across teams. This will be the foundation of my PRD and eventual Roadmap, that I will take to the remaining teams for input.

Specifically, I'd like to then take it to the QA team, for their thoughts on common bugs and less considered problem spots; the Data Science team for data driven trends that would impact this product; Marketing, for potentially difficult aspects to explain to users; and Legal & Privacy, for input on the latest relevant policies that need to be taken into consideration.
