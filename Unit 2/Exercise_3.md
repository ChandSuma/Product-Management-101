Now that you’ve written a PRD for your alarm clock app, you need to break the features out into a roadmap. Break out the roadmap into 4 quarters. Don’t worry too much about the specific sizing… Instead focus on things that should be built together and what order those things should be built in.

1. List out features on the roadmap that should be built in Q1. Make sure to include your rationale for why these features should be built during this timeframe.

### Deploy of basic clock app for iOS and Android

`Goal:` An MVP version of an alarm clock that does the general purposes (see time, set alarms, turn off alarms). Gear for both iOS and Android markets.

`Stretch:` Allow users to customize alarm sounds/vibrations, snooze an alarm, or set multiple alerts leading up to an alarm.

`Why:` Getting our app to the basic functionality allows us to focus on building differentiating features.

Primarily aiming at the US market first, 45% of users are iOS. Android has 2.5 billion monthly active devices worldwide. While the percentage is higher in younger groups, our primary user is 30 years old and up, with families. This means support for both ecosystems is important.

The Apple App Store generates 65% of app driven revenue, despite lower device marketshare. For our app's profitability, presence within the Apple App store is key.

2. List out features on the roadmap that should be built in Q2. Make sure to include your rationale for why these features should be built during this timeframe.

### Integrate Calendars for Auto-Alarms

`Goal:` Give users the ability to connect to Google and Outlook, for both Calendar and Email, to auto-set alarms based on meetings, flights, or unexpected changes.

`Stretch:` categorize meeting types so users can determine what type of alarm they want for each, and how far in advance of the meeting. Add the ability to prioritize specific emails/users (i.e. wife or boss) so alerts are always added for those people.

Google Suite has over 2 billion users. Outlook has 400 million, but serves businesses over individuals primarily. Because our core user is combining work responsibilities with personal life schedules, integrating both is integral to covering majority of user's needs.

`Why:` Users want an app that makes their lives easier. Reducing how many alarms and alerts they need to manually set, while improving their schedule management, will reduce stress and mistakes, making users happier.

Allowing users to customize which meetings require alerts, what type of alert, and allowing them to prioritize important people, will further delight the user.

### Handle Overlapping Alerts

`Goal:` Determine how to handle overlapping meetings in multiple household members.

I.e. If two parents coordinate their work calendars to determine who will take the kids to soccer practice, how will our app handle a change in plans, unexpected meeting, or other conflict? We need to ensure that both parents aren't "booked" in a work meeting, leaving the kids stranded.

Potential solution: auto-reject proposed meetings that overlap with "core responsibilities".

`Stretch:` allow parents to choose days that they will be responsible for children's activities or send a request to the other for a change in plans.

`Why:` When responsibilities (pet, child, caretaking) are involved, it's important to prioritize alerts regarding those to ensure they aren't overridden. By allowing users to indicate what responsibilities take priority over other things, we can better automate alarms for their schedule.

3. List out features on the roadmap that should be built in Q3. Make sure to include your rationale for why these features should be built during this timeframe.

### Traffic & Weather Alarm Updates

`Goal:` Auto-update alarms if traffic indicates it will take longer to get to the destination than anticipated, or if weather is causing delays.

`Stretch:` Toggle whether the user wants this feature turned on for some events (i.e. if timeliness doesn't matter, turn it off to maximize sleep)

`Why:` Users shouldn't have added frustration of being late due to out-of-control elements like traffic accidents and weather. Instead of placing the responsibility of checking these factors on the user, our app can reduce mental overhead by adjusting alarm times automatically if delays are expected.

<br>

### Household Device Integration & Routines

`Goal:` Integrate wifi based devices, like Alexa, Google, lighting, and machines to build alarm routines.

`Why:` Many users' routines involve more than just being alerted -- it means waking up and needing coffee, or going to sleep and dimming the lights. By integrating normally manual activities into their alarm, their lives become easier and more efficient. Our goal is for users to be happier and more relaxed upon waking.

<br>

### Profile Management

`Goal:` Integrate user profiles within a single (family) account, to allow managing (parent) profiles and restricted (child) profiles. Managing profiles can input and setup routines associated with the restricted profiles' alarms - such as dimming lights at childrens' bedtimes to encourage them to sleep.

`Why:` Routine eliminates power struggles and conflict. By automating childrens' routines, it reduces stress and mental overhead on parents, encourages structure and optimal sleep schedules in children, and device integration will allow parents to easily enforce different times.

Routine-based alerts will allow children to take charge of their own activities and responsibilities, giving them increased independence and sense of control. Studies show that delayed or inconsistent bedtimes result in worse behavior the following day, which can affect childrens' studies and optimal development.

4. List out features on the roadmap that should be built in Q4. Make sure to include your rationale for why these features should be built during this timeframe.

### Soothing/Aggressive Alarm Profiles

`Goal:` Allow users to indicate their preferred method of being awakened and alerted, depending on the type of alarm and their specific needs. This might include device and app integration to extend accessibility needs; lighting, sound and volume adjustments; and interactive alarm types, such as puzzle solving, accelerometer readings, and more.

`Why:` Not all users sleep in the same way or have the same motivations. Instead of applying a "one size fits all" approach to alarms, we can offer users a variety of methods that best fit their needs.

If one user is a heavy sleeper and needs to be more timely to work to avoid losing their job, they could choose an aggressive alarm style, that requires problem solving or extended body movement to turn off their alarm. 

If another user struggles with insomnia and their health is affected by poor sleep, they could choose a soothing alarm that uses a combination of natural sounds and increasing light to slowly wake them during an optimal time of their sleep schedule. Our app might also offer white noise or integration with meditation apps to help them fall asleep better, or remind them to do daily meditations.

If our users are of too young an age to read an alarm, their parent can set a light and sound based alarm to let them know when they need to do something - such as a green light and specific song to know it's time to get ready for school.

Perhaps our user has a specific accessibility need, such as vibrations because they are hearing impaired. Our app can offer device integration and accessibility options for non-traditional alarms.

### Sleep Tracking

`Goal:` Integrate sleep tracking capabilities through their phone, Apple watch, Oura or other wearable devices. Show user statistics of their sleep patterns over time and offer the ability to wake them at the most optimal time in their sleep cycle.

`Why:` When users are woken in the midst of their REM cycle, they can suffer from sleep intertia, where high levels of melatonin cause sleepiness and adverse affects. If we can track users' sleep cycles to optimally wake them during non-REM points in their rest, they will feel more alert and well-rested.

Additionally, providing statistics on their sleep will show ways that our app has improved their quality of sleep, to increase NPS and enjoyment of the app.

Integration with existing wearable devices can provide data-forward users with more information about how to optimize their schedule for their mental and physical health, including alerts for moving, walking, exercising, meditating and sleeping.

### Sleep Sounds

`Goal:` Integrate with existing mental wellness and sound apps, like Headspace and Spotify, to allow users to combine existing routines into their alerts - whether for falling asleep, waking up, or exercising.

Also, include a library of white noise and natural sounds for users to fall asleep to.

`Why:` By making it even easier to integrate healthy routines into our users' lives, with applications they already enjoy, users will feel more wellness benefits and ease going through their day.

Including white noise sounds can help users fall asleep more easily, sticking to their routines, and finding more value in our app as differentiation from other options.
