# Lesson Intro

Watch [the lesson intro](https://youtu.be/5SJ9sJ5WMyo).

One of the most important aspects of being a Product Manager, and one of the areas they spend the most time on, is making sure that you are solving the right problems. They have to identify not only what _to_ solve, but also what _not to solve_.

<br>

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- Identifying Opportunities
- Understanding the Market
- The Target User
- Total Addressable Market
- Creating & Evaluating Hypotheses
- Building a Business Case

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Identify problems that are worthwhile to solve
- Understand the market through research
- Identify your target user and build user personas
- Calculate the total addressable market (TAM) for your product
- Calculate the return on investment (ROI) for solving a problem
- Define hypotheses about your product that need to be validated
- Test your hypotheses by putting them in front of users
- Understand the components required to build a business case

# Identifying Opportunities

Watch [Constraints and Tradeoffs](https://youtu.be/kB4z_8GIGgo).

Finding the right problem to solve is critical for the success of your product! If you aren’t focusing on the right problems, your product will fail. This is something that both big and small companies struggle with. You’ll have to work through constraints and tradeoffs.
