# Lesson Intro

Watch [the lesson intro](https://youtu.be/5SJ9sJ5WMyo).

One of the most important aspects of being a Product Manager, and one of the areas they spend the most time on, is making sure that you are solving the right problems. They have to identify not only what _to_ solve, but also what _not to solve_.

<br>

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- Identifying Opportunities
- Understanding the Market
- The Target User
- Total Addressable Market
- Creating & Evaluating Hypotheses
- Building a Business Case

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Identify problems that are worthwhile to solve
- Understand the market through research
- Identify your target user and build user personas
- Calculate the total addressable market (TAM) for your product
- Calculate the return on investment (ROI) for solving a problem
- Define hypotheses about your product that need to be validated
- Test your hypotheses by putting them in front of users
- Understand the components required to build a business case

<br>

# Identifying Opportunities

Watch [Identifying Opportunities](https://youtu.be/kB4z_8GIGgo).

Finding the right problem to solve is critical for the success of your product! 

If you aren’t focusing on the right problems, your product will fail. 

This is something that both big and small companies struggle with. You’ll have to work through constraints and tradeoffs to get this right.

<br>

So how do you figure out which problem to solve?

### Research

`Market Research` is helpful to understand the current space, what products already exist, what the competition is like, and what are the trends.

`User Research` comes in many different forms, like interviews and focus groups. It's critical to go out and talk to users. It's the best way to understand their needs and problems.

<br>

### Product Data

If there is already an existing product and you're looking to create an add-on or follow-up product, the additional data that already exists on the current product can help you understand what problems current users have. By seeing how they're using (or not using) the product, you can identify potential ideas for new features.

<br>

### Support Data

Support data tells you which kinds of issues users are already running into, to reduce bad experiences with customers and the amount of money the company spends on providing support.

<br>

### Efficiency Gains

These are things that will allow you to scale and provide more value over time. If there's a manual process the engineering team has to do, automating that process frees up bandwidth for the team to solve more problems. 

<br>

There are additional challenges, like constraints and tradeoffs.

`Time is limited` - by the hours in a day and the number of team members the company has. Not everything is physically possible to accomplish.

`Different Impact` can determine which problems are more important to solve. A product with negligible impact is likely not worth solving. You need to prioritize the impact your team can have, not just for the user, but also the company.

If products don't meet business goals, the product could be killed or the company could go out of business.

<br>

Business goals might look like increasing or decreasing some of the following:

- Revenue
- New Users
- Engagement
- Costs
- Churn

These will need to be evaluated when you create a business case.

The best product opportunities solve user problems and meet business goals. You want to find overlap between both areas to identify the best problems to solve.

>> "You can change everything in your startup except the market. So spend a lot of time up front to make sure you've thought through your market." - Sam Altman

If your product doesn't solve a problem that resonates with the market, it won't matter how amazing that product is.

<br>
<br>

# Understanding the Market

Watch [Understanding the Market](https://youtu.be/ktgHrSBrJkI).

Understanding the market is critical to building successful products. Some markets are better than others. And some products do a better job than others. 

You’ll want to make sure that your product satisfies the needs of the market.

<br>

What is product market fit?

>> "Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market." - Marc Andreesen

Understanding the market allows you to focus on solving the right problem. Keep in mind that some markets are better than others.

<br>

So what makes a good market?

`Size`: How many people have this problem?

`Growth`: Is the size of the market increasing?

`Acquisition`: How easy is it to gain new customers? How much friction is there for a customer to switch to your product? How easy it is to explain your product's differentiation? How much does it cost to acquire customers?

<br>

What are some signs that there is no product market fit?

- `Users aren't getting value` which causes second order effects: like... 
- `No word of mouth`: they aren't recommending or talking about your product
- `No press buss`: there's no excitement around the product within the press
- `Slow growth` that makes it difficult to sell your product.


On the flip side, when product market fit is good, you'll see these signs:

- `Users get a lot of value` from your product that is solving an important need for them
- `Product practically sells itself` because it's so great. Users recommend it to others. It's easy to immediately understand the value and why someone would pay for it
- `Press excitement`: the press is reaching out to talk to you about your product
- `Product in high demand`, it can sometimes be difficult to keep up. For example, needing to add more servers to support your app.

<br>

To better understand the market, you’ll want to talk to your users and customers. But before you do, you can look at some of these things to get more familiarity with the market:

- `Online research` to better understand what's happening in the market
- `Headlines & News`: staying up to date on relevant news to the problem you're focused on
- `Similar products` to see how they've approached the problem, what's working well and what they're struggling with
- `Trends`: like Mary Meeker’s annual Internet Trends report. [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) can also be a helpful tool to see what people are searching for, and how that's changing over time.

# Exercise: Industry Trends

[The Exercise](https://youtu.be/cI-DUNi-Pjg).

Imagine that the team is interested in building a product to help people better track their fitness and improve their health over time. 

Spend a little bit of time doing some research to better understand current trends in the fitness tracking market.

Here are some questions to get you started:

- What benefits does improving fitness provide?
- What products are already in the market?
- How much do people spend on health/fitness?
- What are the different ways to deliver fitness tracking? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

# Target User

Watch [Target User](https://youtu.be/-J4wBKUyXF0).

Identifying a target user is important, because it makes it very clear who you are building the product for. 

Oftentimes, a problem will best be solved in different ways for different types of users. 

Identifying a target user creates focus and lets you zoom in on solving the needs of that specific target user.

<br>

You would build a different calculator for a grade schooler vs a scientist, because they have different needs and goals that the calculator would need to accomplish. Plus, they have different purchasing power. 

![Different Calculators for Different Users](./Different_Calculators.png)

Keeping your target user in mind helps answer questions about what the product is and can do.

<br>

To define your target user, you want to identify users with shared characteristics who would be interested in your product.

You can do this by collecting data, like market research, interviews, surveys, focus groups, existing customer data, and more.

Once you have the data, you'll need to identify trends in user characteristics like:

- `Demographics:` how old is your user? where do they live?
- `Motivations:` what gets them excited?
- `Goals:` what are they trying to accomplish?
- `Frustrations:` where are they running into current problems and challenges?

<br>

Then you can create `user personas` to represent the target user. The user persona is a fictional person that you create who might use the product. As you develop the product, you'll refer back to your persona to stress test and challenge some of your ideas.

"Does this decision solve Sam's frustration? Would Sam be able to afford this product?"

User personas also allow you to weave in storytelling when explaining objectives and motivations to team members and stakeholders. Storytelling is a more powerful way to show the meaning behind a goal or mission. It brings the target user to life, to build empathy across team members who may not speak with real customers.

<br>

To create a user persona:

-  `Give the persona a name:` a great method is to use alliteration, and have the fictional last name describe an attribute of the target user: `Sam Student` or `Dan Driver`.

- `Add a photo` or illustration of what this user might look like

- `Add a quote` with a key insights about this user. It can be powerful to incorporate real quotes from users you've spoken to during user research.

- `A description` of that user, painting a story about who they are. It doesn't have to be in-depth -- just focused on things that are relevant to the product.

- `Frustrations or challenges` that the user is facing -- like a busy schedule impacting time management. 

- `Goals` that the user has, which the product helps them to achieve.

- `Motivations` that will help shape the product, like "Sam wants to share progress with friends and family," which indicates simple exporting or social sharing would encourage the user to stay engaged with the product.

<br>

# Exercise: Target User

Watch [Target User Exercise Outline](https://youtu.be/5VO5gqXjaTE).

Given the market research that you’ve done so far, create 3 user personas for a fitness tracker. 

Keep in mind, that in the real world you would also want to make sure that you get data from real users through interviews or surveys before building any personas. 

For each persona, create a name and some information about them. Also include their frustrations and goals.

Then, we’ll regroup and walk through the examples that I created.

- [ ] Create three target user personas. Make sure to include the user’s name, a quote, their description, frustrations, & goals)
