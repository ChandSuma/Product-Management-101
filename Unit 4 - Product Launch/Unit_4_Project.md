# Project Details

In this project, we will develop a Launch Plan for the project you have worked on in the earlier courses. You can find updated information about your product on the next page.

<br>
<br>

# Step 1: Update the PRD with Product and Market information

You can use the PRD you started in the Course 2 Project or you can transfer the information into the [Updated PRD Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LYYXCNm92OG28p8CR3GB7L1TvgvVKro9zYeVmjpwt_s/copy). The starter templates are also available to download in the [PMND C4 Starter Templates](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/January/5e176e18_pmnd-c4-project-starter-templates/pmnd-c4-project-starter-templates.zip) in the Lesson Resources in the sidebar.

1. Update or create a PRD with the information you gathered in the earlier courses:

- Background information about the industry or the problem
- Problem Statement: what is the problem your product is solving?
- Product Goals: how does your product solve the problem
- Key Features of your project
- Success Metrics
- Target Market: who are your users and customers?

<br>

2. Add an estimate of the TAM (Total Addressable Market) to your PRD:

Using the techniques you learned in the course, make a quick “back of the envelope” calculation of your addressable market (TAM).
 
 - Document all of your assumptions and reference your sources.

<br>

3. Update the PRD to Identify our competitors:

Use publicly available data and the research techniques you learned in the course to research the competition.

Document all of your assumptions and reference your sources.

- Find at least 2 products that solve the problem we are working on
- Estimate the competitor's revenue and the number of users. This does not need to be precise.

<br>
<br>

# Step 2: Develop the Marketing and Pricing Strategy

1. Develop an Acquisition Channel Strategy

In the PRD Identify at least three channels you can use to reach your users. At least two channels should be non-traditional (not AppStores). Think creatively about how to make your product stand out and be noticed. 

For each channel:
- Describe the channel
- Explain why this channel will work for your product

<br>

2. Develop Guidance to craft the Marketing Message

Write a Marketing Guide to share with the marketing team and include a link to the document in your PRD. You can use [the Marketing Guide Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2CZ3Sl7C0OU__kdJRI21yTlyXoni57yDndCn942KFs/copy) or create your own. 

The Marketing Guide must include:

- Background including a description of the product and the problem it solves for users)
- Market and User information including a description of the target market and competitors
- Product positioning
    - Value proposition
    - Description of the product's three main features
    - At least one screenshot or mock of the product

<br>

3. Set a Pricing Strategy

Add a Pricing section to the PRD that explains the product's pricing strategy

 - Identify and justify the revenue goal for the product. (Remember! Not all products generate revenue directly)
 - Develop a pricing strategy that is consistent with that goal

<br>
<br>

# Step 3: Get Ready for Launch

1. Develop the Pre-Launch Checklist

In the PRD, make a list of the teams you need to work with before launch and what you need to discuss with each team.

<br>

2. Anticipate Risks

In the PRD, identify at least 3 risk factors and develop a plan to mitigate those risks

<br>

3. Prepare the Sales and Customer Support Teams

Write a Training Guide to share with the Sales and Customer Support teams and include a link to the document in your PRD. You can use [the Training Guide Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oz3bUkciqJ4AiPk8Y6cNT_kuFoGDQQoGX0wBYRalmD0/copy) or create your own. 

The Training Guide must include:

- Background including a description of the product and the problem it - solves for users)
- Market and User information including a description of the target - market and competitors
- Product information
    - Description of the product's three main features
    - At least one screenshot or mock of the product
- Pricing

<br>

4. Create User Tools

Write a User Guide for at least two of the product's key features and include links to the documents in your PRD. You can use [the User Guide template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNiZX4E-Pdry4E2_BpkHuf_KVR6ST3k3XAlvKWhlnds/copy) or create your own. 

Each user guide must include:

- A description of the feature
- How to access the feature
- How to use the feature
- At least one screenshot or mock of the product

<br>

# Step 4: Post-Launch Activities

1. Write a Launch email 

The launch email should share your team’s work with the rest of the organization. You can use [the Launch Email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Bhg4H4-7qOl0Cy84t20A7BYJjjMYpdTF1qzp5HMWw0/copy) or create your own. 

The email should include:

- Background information about why the product was developed
- A description of the product and its key features
- Visual representations of launch data
- Next steps based on the updated product scenario

<br>

2. Prepare to iterate the product after launch

- Review the provided post-launch data
- Propose a solution to the problem described in the scenario
- Design an A/B test to determine if the proposed solution will work. In the PRD include the following information about the test:
    - Proposed solution
    - Metric you will use to determine success
    - Control and variant
    - Your hypothesis

# Updated Product Scenarios

## Kaiser Permanente Project

Kaiser Permanente is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. 

Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes.

<br>

### Field Feedback

Your users are adopting the app, but they are not granting you permissions for notifications (only 10% of all your users granted you notifications permissions. What can you do to improve that?

<br>
<br>

## Door Dash Project

Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required. 

Your team has been tasked with building a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).

<br>

### Post-launch data

| Week | Number of deliveries |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| week 1 | 100 |
| week 2 | 300 |
| week 3 | 500 |
| week 4 | 500 |
| week 5 | 600 |

<br>

### Field Feedback

The DoorDash Operations team is generally very happy with your product, but in about 25% of the deliveries with the robots, there are some issues. You believe that it is because the operations team misses some of the robots malfunction. What can you do to address this item?

<br>
<br>

## Amazon Project

Amazon is the world leader in self-publishing for books. They would now like to explore entering into another self-publishing media vertical and are considering either self-published videos or self-published music.

<br>

### Post-launch data
<br>

| Week | Number of videos created | Number of videos posted |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1 | 100 | 50 |
| 2 | 300 | 150 |
| 3 | 500 | 250 |
| 4 | 500 | 250 |
| 5 | 600 | 300 |
| Total | 2,000 | 1,000 |

<br>

| Week | Number of music items recorded | Number of music items posted |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1 | 80 | 40 |
| 2 | 240 | 120 |
| 3 | 400 | 200 |
| 4 | 400 | 200 |
| 5 | 480 | 240 |
| Total | 1,600 | 800 |

<br>

### Field Feedback

Amazon is happy with your product, but they report that in the music sector adoption is about 20% lower than in the self-publishing video sector. What can you do about that?

<br>
<br>

## LinkedIn Project

LinkedIn is trying to expand its job market offerings by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences

<br>

### Post-launch data

<br>

| Week | App Downloads | Active users |
| 1 | 1,000 | 200 |
| 2 | 5,000 | 1,000 |
| 3 | 7,500 | 1,500 |
| 4 | 10,000 | 2,000 |
| 5 | 15,000 | 3,000 |
