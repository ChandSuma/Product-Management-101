## Why Do Product Launches Fail?

There are a number of reasons but here are a few key types of failure:

- A flawed process
- The product doesn't resonate with the user
- Lack of Sales and Customer Support team training

<br>

## Things to Remember About Product Launches

The end of one launch process is a the beginning of a new one
After every launch you need to look at user feedback to help you decide where to take your product next.

Your brain is the the most important tool you will use as a Product Manager.

Although there are a lot of tools that PMs use, the most effective tool is their product intuition. You can sharpen your product intuition through experience and by learning more about how the process works.

<br>

Launches should be celebrated!

A successful product launch is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people. Take the time to celebrate the launch and recognize everyone's contribution.

<br>

Remember, If you donâ€™t launch, no one will ever know about your amazing product!

# Historical Context

Watch [Historical Context](https://youtu.be/aeOfPhdejCU)

Mistakes can be easier to fix because it is easier to update code than recall a physical product.

Modern channels like the App Store make it easier to connect directly with users.

<details>
<summary>How were mobile phone apps launched before the iPhone and AppStore were launched?</summary>

Through mobile carriers, pre-loaded on your device, with a very limited selection of apps. And that was it!
