# Lesson Intro

Watch [the lesson intro](https://youtu.be/TJBPNTrngWQ).

<br>

In this lesson we will cover:

- The partner teams we need to connect with before launch
- Why it is so important to connect with these teams
- Creating collateral for Sales and Customer Support Team
- Writing a user guide for our product


<br>
<br>

# Additional Partner Teams

Watch [Additional Teams We Need to Work With](https://youtu.be/em43Wiman_M)

<br>

`Release notes`: These are notes or documents that will accompany your launch and describe new features or bugs that were fixed. Apple App Store for example, requires Releases notes which contain all the new features coming to your latest release.

`Sales`: The Sales team is responsible for selling your product.

`Customer Support`: Customer support team is the team that takes care of all customer complaints.

`Technical Writers`: Technical writers are responsible for writing all of the documentation in the company. In some cases, they help with UI copy as well.

`Product Specialists`: The Product Specialist role varies based on the company and product. In some cases they work closely with sales and customers with large accounts. In other cases they act as a bridge between Product and support teams.

<br>
<br>

As we get closer to launch we need to work with the teams that are closer to the users:

- Sales
- Customer support
- Technicals Writers
- Product Specialists

<br>

How is it different for different types of products?

There will be different workflows if you work on different types of products:

`Consumer`: you will probably work closely with Customer Support, maybe with Technical Writers if there is a help center for your product.

`Enterprise Product`: you might work with all different teams, including Sales, Technical Writers, Customer Support. It all depends on your product and the structure of your company

<br>

How to work with different teams?

- Create collaterals and documentation
- You must work closely with them because they own the communication channels with your users
- Your role is to empower these teams to be successful by providing them information about the product

<br>

What if there are none of these functions in your startup?

Then it is probably your responsibility as the Product Manager to handle these items.

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: What Do We Need?

We are getting closer to the launch of our Party App. It is time to figure out which other teams we need to work with and what collateral materials they need to support our launch.

Remember that we have two types of users for our app: party organizers and vendors.

Also remember that we are a well-supported startup with fully staffed engineering, marketing, sales, legal, testing and customer support teams.

- [ ] Determine which partner teams we need to work with (remember, we need help for both types of users)
- [ ] Figure out what type of collateral materials we need to create for each team

<br>
<br>

Watch [the solution walkthrough](https://youtu.be/7iu3W1R6Wbc).

<br>

Partner Teams We Need to Work With

- Sales Team for outreach to sign the vendors up for our platform
- Technical Writer to write our release notes for the App Store
- Customer Support to help with user questions and issues

<br>

Collateral Materials We Need to Create
- Guidance for Sales on how to sell our product
- Help center information and articles
- Guidance for the Customer Support team

# Working with Sales & CS

Watch [Working with Sales and Customer Support Teams](https://youtu.be/0v0imR2ZZVI)

<br>

Smaller companies might not have as many defined teams and processes so the PM may have wider responsibilities

Give the Sales and Customer Support teams enough time to get approvals, prepare communications and do the necessary training.

Inform the Sales and Customer Support teams every time you add features to your product so they are prepared to sell and support the new feature

Think about tools that you may need to build so that the support team can help and debug issues for users

<br>
<br>

## Materials for Sales and CS

Watch [Sales and Customer Support Collateral Materials](https://youtu.be/m487RIyXu84)

<br>

What to Include in Collateral Materials for Sales Team
- Our value proposition
- How our product solves the user's problem
- Our product vs. competitor's products

<br>

What to Include in Collateral Materials for Customer Support Team
- Product overview
- Potential issues for users and work arounds
- Current vs. future product
- Known bugs

<br>
<br>

# Example: Working with Sales & CS

Watch [Example: Working with Sales and Customer Support](https://youtu.be/ypS7wVzC2qo)

<br>

You can learn a lot about your product by sitting next to support and listening to in on their calls with our customers

The Sales Team can help you understand customer needs better by sharing what they hear from customers and potential customers

Important! Your role is to understand and solve the underlying problem.
The solution the customers are asking for might not be the best solution for the problem they are having.


<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Sales and Support

We want to make sure that our Sales and Customer Support teams are ready for our launch. We need to create collateral materials to help them.

Remember:

Our Sales team will be mostly working with vendors to bring them to our platform.

Our Customer Support Team will be working with both vendors and the party organizers who use our app.

You can create your own guides or you can use this template: [Training Guide for Sales and Customer Support Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oz3bUkciqJ4AiPk8Y6cNT_kuFoGDQQoGX0wBYRalmD0/copy)

# User Guides

Watch [User Guides](https://youtu.be/qL20Qz0IlSs)

<br>

There are a lot of tools on the market today to create a help center or support center.

Users want to be able to express their opinions and provide feedback.

Remember that you are building your product for your users.

# Exercise: User Guide

Watch [Example: User Guide](https://youtu.be/YYVoa9uMkK4)

<br>

We were launching a totally new product so it had to be very well documented.

We shared our PRD with the Technical Writers team to make sure they understand the product and its details.

We also shared:
- Main flows
- Known issues
- Issues that would not be solved before launch
- Specific scenarios about how to use the product

<br>
<br>

## Exercise

As we get ready to launch our Party App, we need to create documentation for our users. Let's start writing a User Guide for our party organizer users.

You can create your own guides or you can use this template: [User Guide Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNiZX4E-Pdry4E2_BpkHuf_KVR6ST3k3XAlvKWhlnds/copy).

- [ ] Make a list of the tasks a user would perform when using the Party App

- [ ] Choose two tasks and write step-by-step instructions to guide the user through completing each task

- [ ] Choose a feature of the app and write a guide to help the user find and use that feature

<br>
<br>

Watch [the solution walkthrough](https://youtu.be/5OzHX8XZt60).

<br>

There are a lot of different things a party organizer can with with our app, but I am going to focus on these two scenarios:

 - Signing up for our product
 - Organizing a party

And then we will outline these flows in detail, including screenshots.

Since our product will connect users to vendors it might require payments. We will show our users where to find their payment methods.

View the final solution User Guide [here](./user_guide.pdf).

<br>

### Enrichment Activity
Analyze the help pages of your favorite product.

- What do you like about the pages?
- What don't you don't like?
- How easy is it to find a solution for a problem with the product?

# Recap

Watch [the lesson recap](https://youtu.be/8JoXUqFGSEA).

<br>

Before We Move On...

Sales is the voice of the customer

Customer Support can be a great resource

Monitor the support tickets

If you have technical writers, use them!

Use all the help you can get!

You should not be creating your product in a vacuum

<br>

Listen to people, get their feedback, show that you care what they think. You will achieve more through collaboration than on your own.
