# Lesson Intro

Watch [The Lesson Intro](https://youtu.be/ZJxpMcyaJQM)

<br>

In this lesson we’ll cover the following topics:

Setting up a launch process
Scaling your product
Mitigating the risks for your launch


<br>
<br>

# Defining Your Launch Process

Watch [Defining Your Launch Process](https://youtu.be/7Idc32_b6RQ)

<br>

`Product Launch`: The step in your product development when you completed your product and you are ready to launch it in the market.

`KPI` (Key Performance Indicator): In the case of product launch, KPI is a quantifiable measurement of performance that is used to evaluate the success of a product launch or other business objectives.

<br>

## Things to Remember About the Launch Process

- Planning ahead is critical.
The launch process should be set up before product development is complete.

- Involve key partners
Every launch is different but in most cases you'll want to engage with the engineering, testing teams, marketing, sales, privacy and legal.

- Define your metrics before the launch 
This will give you time to design an effective feedback mechanism to measure the product's success.

<br>

## Typical Launch

Every launch is different but they often include steps like these:

Define your criteria for launch. List the partners who need to be should be aware of your launch
- Legal
- Managers and leadership
- Technical support
- Marketing
- Technical


Create a timeline of what should happen and when. If you have a release manager and/or a program manager you'll need their input on the timeline

The process should work for you and not you for the process.

<br>
<br>

<details>
<summary>True or False: The launch process starts as soon as product development is complete</summary>
False - You are waiting too long if you wait until the product is complete.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Who should you discuss your launch with?
</summary>
Engineering, testing, sales, and privacy.
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Example: App Store Launch

Watch [Launch Process Example: Getting Ready for the App Store](https://youtu.be/lKJWh-GHVBY)

<br>

`P0`: A high-priority issue that must be fixed before launch.

`P1`: An issue that is a high priority but not necessarily a launch blocker. The Product Manager, Testing and Engineering teams need to decide if the issue should be fixed before launch.

<br>

## Our Launch Process for the App Store

1. The legal team reviewed our TOS (terms of service), our privacy data storage and all legal items and gave us ok at least 2 weeks before the launch.

2. Testing is complete. All the bugs are reviewed and assessed. No P0 or P1 are left.

3. The engineering team gave their ok for the launch. They have a dedicated person on call for the day of the release. They have all the metrics and monitors in place.

4. The marketing team is ready and gave their ok for launch. They already have prepared blog posts and their marketing plan

5. Release notes will be ready at least one week before the submission to Apple. All visual elements for the store are ready

6. Leadership reviewed our project and gave us a green light 3 weeks before the launch.

7. We are ready at least 3 days before the submission to the App Store.

8. We submit the app to the AppStore

9. App is approved

10. Push the button! (and watch for metrics including downloads post-launch crashes)

<br>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Should all P0 issues must be fixed before launch?
</summary>
Yes - P0 issues are launch blockers, which means that you should not launch until they are resolved!
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Should all P1 issues must be fixed before launch?
</summary>
Maybe - You'll need to discuss P1 issues with your Testing and Engineering teams. Some P1 issues need to be fixed before launch -- and others can be fixed later.
</details>

# Why Launch Process Matters

Watch [Why Having a Good Launch Process Matters](https://youtu.be/s5qhuAvl6-M)

<br>

As a product manager, you are measured by your launches.

Having a good process eliminates the stress in the launch

Mistakes will happen but having a good process will help keep mistakes to a minimum.

Learn from your mistakes and better yet, share your learnings with a broader team.

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Launch Process

## Create a Launch Process

Now that you have learned about how to set up a launch process, it is your turn to give it a try with our party organization app.

We know it is a mobile app for iOS, so we know we will need to submit our app for a review with Apple so we can get it in the App Store. Think about the teams you need to talk to and the steps you need to take to prepare for launch.

- [ ] Determine which teams you need to talk to and what you need from each team
- [ ] Set the order of each step
- [ ] Define the KPIs for your launch

<br>
<br>

Watch [the solution walkthrough](https://youtu.be/lHs4gPjMZv4).

Your solution might be different -- but here is what I would do:

1. We will define the teams we need to get approvals from:
- Legal
- Marketing
- Engineering
- Sales
- Leadership
- Privacy

2. We will seek all approvals ahead of the launch, where privacy and legal should be discussed ahead of the release, in case there are any concerns

3. We will get approval from our leadership for the launch

4. Testing approval is the last step in the process

5. Once we have all approvals, we will make sure we are ready for submission to Apple and line up technical support for the launch itself.

<br>
<br>

Think through your experience, at your company:

Have you seen a good launch process?
How does your company handle new product/features launches?

# Scaling Your Product

Watch [Introduction to Scaling Products](https://youtu.be/D9gQDoYrMa8)

<br>

`Scaling your product`: Launching your product to more markets. It can be a new geography, or a new language, a completely new market.

<br>

`Research is extremely important when going after a new market`

You can’t just copy your product from one market to another without validating that your product will work the same way in the new market. Your marketing and your acquisition channels also might require some changes.

<br>

`New Market = New Culture`

Work with local experts or find ways to understand the culture of your potential market. Cultural norms and expectations can differ widely from place to place.

<br>

`Don’t forget to check local laws`
Confirm that your product is legal in your new market. There may be different requirements in the new market.

<br>

# Where Next?

Watch [How Do You Decide Where to Launch Next?](https://youtu.be/RKiXIqo0qHQ)

<br>

`Left to right` or `right to left`: the way some of the languages described, meaning the way you start writing. English is a left-to-right language, while Arabic is “right-to-left”

<br>

### Key Questions to Ask when Considering a New Market

- How many potential customers are there in the new market?
- Do you need to change the language?
- Are there any cultural differences?
- Will we incur any new costs to launch in the new market?

<br>

### Things to Remember About Considering a New Market
- Language is not just translation

- Languages vary in length, which can affect your UI. Languages might have cultural interpretations and meanings. Some languages are right to left and not left to right, it is important if you are launching in a country with a different language to validate that your product works.

- Test Everything!!!! Ask local users for direct feedback. And don’t forget to leverage your team. You probably are working with a very diverse group of coworkers so engage them and ask for their help.

<br>
<br>

# Scaling Example

Watch [Example: Scaling to Global Markets](https://youtu.be/fnddVM4lWhk)

<br>

## Scaling to Different Markets and Languages

#### Quick Wins

When looking for the next market you will need to balance speed to market and research. Quick wins are important to gain the trust of your leadership

#### Easiest Market

We started with the easiest market to launch in: Canada. We launched in English first

#### Expand to New Languages

It is a good idea to work on the translations ahead of time if you are planning global expansion. We supported all the languages supported by our company.

#### Prioritization

Do ruthless prioritization for your resources and time. Translation takes time, adjusting your product to a new country takes time. Plan ahead and make sure you are chasing the right priorities. We prioritized our biggest markets first, to maximize the exposure.

#### Understanding your User and Market

We spent a lot of time analyzing our data on different markets and learning which market should go next.

<br>
<br>

<details>
<summary>When you are launching in a new language, it is ok just to translate your product?</summary>
No - It is a great idea to engage your coworkers and ask for their opinion or use Google Translate, but they may not have a deep enough understanding of the language and culture to fully translate the product.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>You are a product manager for a mobile game app which is very successful in the US. What would be a good next step?</summary>
- We will look at our current user base and see if we can find another market with a lot of gamers who have a similar profile
- We will check local laws for any restrictions on mobile gaming
- We just participated in a gaming convention and we learned about new research pointing to a country Y. We will invest more to investigate that option.

# Why Scaling is Important

Watch [Why Scaling is Important](https://youtu.be/AhZFJzz6VNQ)

<br>


Not all products are scalable outside of their primary market

Knowing when and how to scale are important

Products need to evolve and grow to stay relevant


<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Scaling Your Product

Now that you have discussed how you scale your product, it is your turn to give it a try with our party organization app.

For this scenario, we will assume we are very successful in the US market (English only) and we are ready to launch into other countries and languages. Your job is to figure out where we should launch our product next.

- [ ] List the demographic, market or cultural factors that would be positive for our app
- [ ] Define the metrics we need to assess these factors
- [ ] List any issues that you need to consider to help you decide which language to translate to next
- [ ] Use your analysis to decide which country to launch the product in next

<br>
<br>

Watch [the solution walkthough](https://youtu.be/q8zRFGssmxs)

Here is what I would do:

1. Find a country or culture where parties are extremely important:

- Israel because many 12-13 years olds have a big party for their Bar or Bat Mitzvah

2. Define the metrics that will help us make our decision:

- How many 12-13 years olds are there in Israel?

3. List the language issues:

- Need to translate to Hebrew, and possibly Russian and Arabic too
- Must make sure the app can work with a Right-to-Left language because Hebrew is RTL

# Identifying Risks

Watch [Identifying and Mitigating Risks](https://youtu.be/KiAt9dvmH9I)

<br>

`Edge Case`: the scenario in the product which is not typical but can occur in certain circumstances

`Rollback Plan`: the plan you put together if you need to ”undo” your launch.

<br>

## Identifying Risks for a New Product Launch

- Is the product finished?
- Has it been tested?
- Do we have enough support?
- Did we notify all of our partners?
- Did we check with Legal?
- Did we think about what can go wrong?
- Do we have a rollback plan?

Our biggest risk is MISCOMMUNICATION!!!

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or False: a good PM should be able to identify all of the possible risks in the launch process.</summary>
False - A good PM should be able to identify most of the critical risks, but nobody is perfect and every launch is different. Even the best plan might miss a low probability scenario.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>You notice a legal risk for your product. What do you do?</summary>
Here is what I would do. First, I would immediately inform my legal team and ask for their help in confirming and mitigating the issue. I would also notify leadership and the rest of my team
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Risks Example

Watch [Example: Risks in Launching a Product to Multiple Countries](https://youtu.be/Mpa1edXFu98)

<br>

`Gradual Roll Out`: When instead of launching our product to 100% of your users, you gradually increase the percent of users seeing/using your product

<br>

## Understanding and Mitigating Risks

#### Know your product

Each product is different and will have different risks. If you are new to a product, ask a lot of questions, especially about any previous failures.

#### Talk to all the right people

Make sure that you are in contact with all of the relevant teams including engineering, testing, legal, marketing, sales, support and more.

#### Keep assessing the risks

Just because you already have previously launched a product, you can't be sure that it won't break again. Things break, even if “nobody touched them”.


#### Pay extra attention to anything new or special

New things tend to break more. Make sure that you analyze the potential risks in a new or unique situation.


#### Give everyone enough time to do their job

Do your best to provide all of your teams the time they need and you will gain credibility as a person who sets reasonable deadlines. This will be helpful when you are up against a tight deadline and you need to convince people to work more hours and go the extra mile for you. That happens, a lot!

#### Make a plan for when things go wrong

Nobody likes to think about what can go wrong - but as a PM it is your job to be prepared. Planning for the worst case scenario makes it easier to quickly handle problems when they arise.

#### Plan, communicate and then execute

A launch without a good plan will have more chances to fail. A plan that isn't communicated, can't be executed.

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Identifying Risks

Identifying Risks in Scaling to the EU

Now that you have discussed what kind of risks your product can run into, it is your turn to give it a try with our party organization app.

For this scenario, we will assume we are very successful in the US market (English only) and we are ready to launch into other countries and languages. The European Union looks like a good option. What risks can you identify for launching in the EU market?


- [ ] Identify general risks in launching a product
- [ ] Identify the risks specific to launching to the EU
- [ ] Write a simple mitigation plan for each risk

<br>
<br>

Watch [solution walkthrough](https://youtu.be/-ygN5G9j_i8).

<br>

### My Risks Plan

General Risks

Engineering: Talk to the Engineering team and confirm that our system can handle the extra pressure of the market expansion

Testing: Test the UI for the new languages

<br>

International Risks

Translation: The EU has 24 different languages. Confirm that all of the translations are ready.

Marketing: Our marketing messages need to work in all of the EU countries. Marketing will need a lot of time to prepare all of the materials

<br>
<br>

### Are We Ready to Launch?

Did we finish all the parts of product development? Don’t just assume we are done. Talk to our engineering team and test the product. Does it do what it is supposed to do?

Did we finish all the testing? Do not just assume that all the testing has been done. Test even the most crazy scenarios and think through edge cases. Make sure that you personally test your product (if possible).

Did we set you the right date for our launch? Did we secure all the technical support we need for launch? Do we have the right support if something goes wrong?

Did we give enough time to all of our partners? What if one of our teams doesn't have enough time to complete their pre-launch tasks? Do we have a plan for that? Make sure to think beyond the immediate partners and consider all of the tasks that need to be completed for launch.

Did we cover all our legal bases? Do we understand all of the risks? Do we feel confident that we are prepared to handle them?

Did we think about the worst-case scenario? What is our worst-case scenario? Are we prepared for it? Do we have a rollback plan?

Have we communicated enough? Communicate, communicate, communicate. That will save a lot of headaches.

# Recap

Watch [the lesson recap](https://youtu.be/YeopOaeVA30).

<br>

### Mistakes will happen:
The best way to minimize these mistakes is by planning ahead. Write down your plan and communicate it. Don’t assume people know what you are doing, because chances are they don’t. Communicating a clear plan gives you a vote of confidence.

### Time is important:
You will have a lot of stressful launches, where time is extremely short. When you can and have enough time, don’t wait till the last minute to loop in your partners because they might have other priorities.

### Think outside of the box:
Whether it is a launch, thinking through risks or thinking about how to scale your product, find creative ways to do things faster or better. When thinking about risks, think beyond the obvious ones.

### Learn, research and ask for help:
When the time comes and you need to scale your product, learn and research what you can and ask others for help. Great planning goes a long way when you need to scale your product. Think about how you can get quick wins, what can be done fast and what needs more work. Consider your markets, which one has the higher potential.

### Be the glue:
You are the glue of the team, you are the motivator, you are the one who is going to push the team in the hard moments. That is why it is important to remember to encourage your team and get to know your team. Say thank you to your team members, show your appreciation.
