# What is Product Management?

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/bTKNTW4C83o).

Product Managers spend a lot of their time:

- Identifying/defining problems
- Creating a strategy
- Communicating
- Coordinating development
- Responding to fires

Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:

- What are we building?
- Who are we building this for?
- Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
- When are we building this?

PM's are the only role that sees the product developed through the entire process and is the glue that has end-to-end visibility to connect teams that don't normally shares goals and objectives (design, marketing, engineering).

They consistently adapt to new information and tackle unexpected fires/bugs.

# Why Product Management is Important

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/U6suk4zjXdI).

Product Management is important because building products is more complicated than ever. 

At the core, Product Managers focus on making sure that the team is building products that people want. 

Additionally, Product Management plays an important role in connecting and aligning all the relevant teams needed to build and launch a product.

There’s an infinite number of problems that could be solved. Product Managers identify and define problems for the team to solve while making sure that:

- the problem is real
- the users are real
- the solution provides value


Product Managers are critical because they are who focuses on the user and the problem, and orchestrates teams working together. But they do more than just problem solving. They choose the _right_ problem to solve that is also a successful (profitable) product for real users.

Google Glasses was a great technology...without solving problems for real users. 

PM's also need to `create value for users and the company` (either users paying for the product, or being willing to see ads in your product). If the users are too niche, it's not a viable business.

PM's are a hub, connecting various functions and teams across the company, to get everyone united behind a shared goal.

### Examples of Products with Great and Bad Product Management

Great companies...

`Whatsapp`: easy to use communication app
`OpenTable`: easy to use, hyper-focused app for making reservations at restaurants, helping users find restaurants and restaurants bring in users.
`Headspace`: helps users manage stress and sleep better at night.


Bad companies...

`MoviePass`: a subscription app for going to movies, that lowered their price too much, creating an unsustainable business model that was bankrupted
`Everpix`: a photo management app that auto-sorts and identifies great photos for users. It had great UI but only a small user base willing to pay.
`Google Wave`: Google's attempt at the future of collaboration but without a clear user goal. Too much functionality and complexity. 

A product is too complex if you can't explain what it does in a couple sentences.

# A Quick History Lesson

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/e2iwNxIo0mQ).

It’s difficult to map out the entire history of how Product Management came into being… But there are some key moments:

`1931` - Neil McElroy and "Brand Men" Neil McElroy wrote a memo called "Brand Men" while at Procter & Gamble. This memo touched on two parts of this new role that carried into product management:

- `“Full responsibility”` - Product managers are responsible for the success of their product. They need to work across multiple teams in order to achieve their goals and build great products.

- `“Studying things personally at first hand”` - Getting out of the building, seeing problems first hand, and interacting with users is a critical part of the product management role. This experience will provide you with deep insights and build empathy for your users.

<br>

`1930s` - Bill Hewlett and David Packard These two entrepreneurs met while at Stanford. McElroy was an advisor of theirs and they were deeply influenced by him. They went on to found Hewlett-Packard in 1939. And one of HP’s key strategies was to put decision making as close to the customer as possible. Being close to your customers and understanding their needs is a core part of product management.

<br>

`1960s` - Japan After World War II, just-in-time manufacturing became common in Japan. In addition to reducing waste during the production process, there were also two important principles:

- `Kaizen`: change for better - continuously improving the business while always driving for innovation and evolution. Today you see Product Managers driving constant improvements and optimizations for their products.

- `Genchi genbutsu` - real location, real thing - This means going to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions. This is again, highlighting the importance for Product Managers to get out of the building and experience everything first hand.

<br>

Product Managers originally started in the marketing function and focused on making sure the product is in the right place, at the right price, with the right promotion. As tech began to create giant new industries, it became crucial that products were developed to more deeply meet user needs.
