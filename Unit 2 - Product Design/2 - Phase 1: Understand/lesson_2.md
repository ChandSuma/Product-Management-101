# DEFINE

Watch [Phase 2 of the Design Sprint: DEFINE](https://youtu.be/DNeHIktCQVQ)

The second phase of the Design sprint is Define. The goal of this phase is to create focus on what you want to achieve and how you will define success. Once you’ve identified that vision, it becomes much easier to understand and frame all the other steps you will need to take to realize that vision.

<br>

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Define phase of the Design Sprint
- Creating focus by starting with desired outcomes, using a variety of different methods:
- Success Metrics
- Design Principles
- Future Press Release

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Define phase of the Design Sprint
- Describe why starting at the end is beneficial
- Define success metrics using the HEART framework
- Define Design Principles
- Write a Future Press Release

<br>

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Success Metrics | A way to measure whether or not your project achieved its goals |
| HEART Framework | A framework which was created at Google to measure quality of user experience at scale |
| Goal | something that a user is trying to accomplish |
| Signal | behavior (ie: generally something a user would do) that allows you to tell if a user achieved their goal |
| Metric | measurement of a signal |

# Define Success Metrics

Watch [Defining Success Metrics.](https://youtu.be/ffO8nPiWytA)

The HEART framework is a user-centered method to define metrics that measure the quality of the user experience. It’s simple and easy to understand and can help with decision making in later phases. 

There are five dimensions:

- `Happiness` - user attitude towards your product

- `Engagement` - how users are using the product in terms of frequency or 
number/types of features used

- `Adoption` - how many new users start using your product

- `Retention` - how many users keep coming back

- `Task Success` - ability for users to complete critical tasks in order to 
be successful with the product

<br>

Across these dimensions, you will then want to start by identifying goals, then signals, and finally metrics to measure how well your product is doing.

A `goal` is something the user is trying to do or something you are trying to help them to do

A `signal` is a change in user behavior that indicates that the user is achieving the goal

A `metric` is a way to measure signal and quantify how much user behavior has changed

Keep in mind that it’s ok for goals to have multiple signals and metrics. 

It’s also not necessary to have metrics for every dimension. It’s more important to pick things that are relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.

# Exercise: HEART Framework

Using the HEART Framework for the Grocery Store Chain

Let's apply the HEART Framework to what we've learned about the Grocery Store Chain's problem with online shopping and delivery services.

- [ ] Make a copy of the [HEART Framework Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxOQgdTUcpd20f_Fov8yxZ2VkbmEoG_GopcvSPINfaE/copy)

- [ ] Write at least two user centered goals

- [ ] Identify which signals will affect reaching each goal

- [ ] Create metrics to measure the signals
