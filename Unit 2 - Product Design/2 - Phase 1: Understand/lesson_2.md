# DEFINE

Watch [Phase 2 of the Design Sprint: DEFINE](https://youtu.be/DNeHIktCQVQ)

The second phase of the Design sprint is Define. The goal of this phase is to create focus on what you want to achieve and how you will define success. Once you’ve identified that vision, it becomes much easier to understand and frame all the other steps you will need to take to realize that vision.

<br>

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Define phase of the Design Sprint
- Creating focus by starting with desired outcomes, using a variety of different methods:
- Success Metrics
- Design Principles
- Future Press Release

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Define phase of the Design Sprint
- Describe why starting at the end is beneficial
- Define success metrics using the HEART framework
- Define Design Principles
- Write a Future Press Release

<br>

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Success Metrics | A way to measure whether or not your project achieved its goals |

# Define Success Metrics

Watch [Defining Success Metrics.](https://youtu.be/ffO8nPiWytA)

The HEART framework is a user-centered method to define metrics that measure the quality of the user experience. It’s simple and easy to understand and can help with decision making in later phases. 

There are five dimensions:

- `Happiness` - user attitude towards your product

- `Engagement` - how users are using the product in terms of frequency or 
number/types of features used

- `Adoption` - how many new users start using your product

- `Retention` - how many users keep coming back

- `Task Success` - ability for users to complete critical tasks in order to 
be successful with the product

<br>

Across these dimensions, you will then want to start by identifying goals, then signals, and finally metrics to measure how well your product is doing.

A `goal` is something the user is trying to do or something you are trying to help them to do

A `signal` is a change in user behavior that indicates that the user is achieving the goal

A `metric` is a way to measure signal and quantify how much user behavior has changed

Keep in mind that it’s ok for goals to have multiple signals and metrics. 

It’s also not necessary to have metrics for every dimension. It’s more important to pick things that are relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.

<br>

### The HEART Framework

| Topic | Goal | Signals | Metrics |
| ----- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| Happiness | ? | ? | ? |
| Engagement | ? | ? | ? |
| Adoption | ? | ? | ? |
| Retention | ? | ? | ? |
| Task success | ? | ? | ? |

# Exercise: HEART Framework

Using the HEART Framework for the Grocery Store Chain

Let's apply the HEART Framework to what we've learned about the Grocery Store Chain's problem with online shopping and delivery services.

- [ ] Make a copy of the [HEART Framework Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxOQgdTUcpd20f_Fov8yxZ2VkbmEoG_GopcvSPINfaE/copy)

- [ ] Write at least two user centered goals

- [ ] Identify which signals will affect reaching each goal

- [ ] Create metrics to measure the signals

<br>
<br>

# Solution: HEART Framework

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/qO5y1sokvY4)

Success metrics are important because they allow you to quantify how successful your project is. By identifying your success metrics upfront, it sets a clear target for the team to understand what is considered success.

Google’s HEART framework is a user-centered system that helps you to create metrics based on user goals.

<br>

The solution template might look like so:

<br>

| Topic | Goal | Signals | Metrics |
| ----- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| Happiness | Efficient pick up | Waiting for pick up | Average wait time |
| Engagement | Buy products | Product added to cart | Average number of products purchased per cart |
| Adoption | Share with friends | Refer a friend | Referral sign up rate |
| Retention | Automatic ordering of basics | Opt in to auto orders | Average number of auto ordered items per user per month. Percentage of users with auto-order |
| Task success | Find item easier later | Item added to shopping list | Percentage of users with items on list |

<br>

# Design Principles

Watch [Design Principles.](https://youtu.be/X30Doxbcl_k)

Design principles guide the way that you think about building your product. Design principles are usually short just a word or two, followed by a brief explanation.

<details>
<summary>Which of the following is an example of good design principle? "Use the company colors", "Minimize the number of clicks", "Use animations at each success events" </summary>

Minimize the number of clicks.
</details>

<br>


<details>
<summary>True or false: Design Principles should be lengthy in order to capture the full intent.</summary>

False - Design Principles should be short and easy to understand.

# Exercise: Design Principles

Design Principles for the Grocery Store Chain Product

Let's identify the design principles for the Grocery Store Chain product. Spend 5-10 minutes brainstorming about the guiding principles that matter most when trying to address the Grocery Store Chain's challenges with online shopping and delivery services.

What is most important for this project?

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Design Principles

Watch [the design pricinples solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/il8wAn9UtZg)

Design principles are guidelines that should craft how you think about building your product. By aligning on design principles with your team, it also makes decision making easier because you can frame questions in the context of your design principles.

When you are writing design principles with your team, you should capture each principle with a word or two and a short explanation that explains the intent in more detail. When you refer to your design principles later you can just refer to the short version.

# Future Press Release

Watch [writing a future press release.](https://youtu.be/DBUwtP2OuU8)

Writing a future press release or review about your product is a great way to get everyone on the team aligned on the outcomes you are trying to achieve. They also can be fun to write. The main difference between a press release and a review is that a press release is being told from your point of view while a review would be written from the perspective of a third party.

When you’re writing a press release or review it will be important to include the following components

- Name of the product (although this doesn’t have to be final and can change)
- Who is the target user?
- What problem does your product solve?
- How does your product solve this problem?
- Why your team built this
- Why should users care?
- How do users react to your product?
- What sets this product apart from others?
- How can users get the product

<br>

- Write this for an external audience that is not familiar with the space

- When talking about the solution focus on what the product does rather than how it does it

`WHAT`: Takes amazingly clear pictures at night

`HOW`: captures several images on shutter press with varying exposure lengths and processes images through a machine learning algorithm to compose rich, detailed images in low light conditions

<br>

<details>
<summary></summary>
False - While your future press release will probably have some similarities it will be best to write a separate press release as it gets closer to launch. The future press review is a method in the design sprint intended to align your team on the outcomes of the solution you’ll build.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Write the headline for a press release for a product that automatically replies to emails about scheduling.</summary>
Make sure that the headline will capture people’s attention and does a good job conveying the main value or differentiator of your product.
</details>

# Exercise: Future Tweet

Future Tweet for Grocery Store Chain Product

Let's write a Tweet to tell everyone about our product. Remember, a Tweet needs to be fewer than 140 characters.

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Future Tweet

Watch [the future tweet solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/lOtya1_FbkY)

An example tweet might be: 

> Your groceries, now on autopilot. Never wait in checkout line ever again. Your groceries are ready as soon as you walk in.

Future Press Release / Review is a method that allows you to create definition of what the success of your product looks like in the future. When writing these types of statements, it’s important to address key topics like the problem you are solving, who you are solving the problem for, the solution you arrived at, and why this matters.
