# DEFINE

Watch [Phase 2 of the Design Sprint: DEFINE](https://youtu.be/DNeHIktCQVQ)

The second phase of the Design sprint is Define. The goal of this phase is to create focus on what you want to achieve and how you will define success. Once you’ve identified that vision, it becomes much easier to understand and frame all the other steps you will need to take to realize that vision.

<br>

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Define phase of the Design Sprint
- Creating focus by starting with desired outcomes, using a variety of different methods:
- Success Metrics
- Design Principles
- Future Press Release

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Define phase of the Design Sprint
- Describe why starting at the end is beneficial
- Define success metrics using the HEART framework
- Define Design Principles
- Write a Future Press Release

<br>
