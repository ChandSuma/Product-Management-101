# Unit Overview

Watch [the unit overview.](https://youtu.be/fcBKmn0d27w)

This unit is for students who are interested in learning how to bring an idea through concept, design, and user validation, as well as creating a spec to handoff to engineering. You’ll learn more about how you can use Design Thinking to diverge in order to explore ideas and then ultimately focus in and converge on a single idea. Equally important is mapping out the full concept and creating a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.

At the end of this unit and after completing your project, you will be able to:

- Organize and run a Design Sprint to create a product that solves a user need
- Create sketches, storyboards, and build interactive prototypes
- Design a research plan to validate product concept and identify usability issues along critical user journeys
- Recruit participants and conduct usability tests following a research plan
- Translate user insights into product improvements

<br>

Watch [the lesson overview.](https://youtu.be/KLnwxXpKVXw)

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- What is a Design Sprint
- Identifying the right problems for a Design Sprint
- Planning a Design Sprint
- Working with Designers

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe what a Design Sprint is
- Identify good candidates for a Design Sprint
- Plan a Design Sprint
- Explain the similarities and differences between the Product Manager and Designer roles

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Design Spring | A design thinking based time constrained process to explore and reduce the risk of building new products or features. Design Sprints are most often discussed in the context of product development but can also be applied to internal process improvement |
| Design Thinking | A human centered, iterative approach to solve problems through deeply understanding users and needs, redefining problems, creating innovative solutions, and testing them |

# What is a Design Sprint

Watch [What is a Design Sprint?](https://youtu.be/MOLthh86cbQ)

> “A Design Sprint is a time-constrained process that uses design thinking with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market.” -- Wikipedia

A Design Sprint...

- Allows the team to explore and learn without actually building
- Means the process can fail early without serious consequences
- Creates buy-in and ownership among the team

<br>

The Design Sprint process is highly customizable and can be adapted to the specifics of each challenge.

A Design Sprint is a tool that allows you to relatively quickly explore new ideas and validate them. They work best when the sprint team is composed of cross functional members. There’s no one size fits all Design Sprint-- you should tailor it to meet the specific needs of your business, team, and users.

# Phases of a Design Sprint

Watch [the Phases of a Design Sprint.](https://youtu.be/K3yLJNZLJLs)

There are six phases of a Design Sprint.

1. `Understand`
Create a shared understanding of the problem space, the user, the competition, and why it all matters. Align as a team on a focus moving forward for the rest of the sprint

<br>

2. `Define`
Start by focusing on where you want to end. By setting goals you can work backwards to understand what needs to happen in order to get there.

<br>

3. `Sketch`
Ideate. Start diverging and exploring lots of different solutions.

<br>

4. `Decide`
Bring it all back together and decide on one idea to take through prototyping and validation

<br>

5. `Prototype`
Map out and build a prototype of your idea

<br>

6. `Validate`
Check to make sure that your idea is solving a real user need… and that it can be built!

<br>

Each phase has a set of tools that can be used to facilitate reaching the goal of each phase. Remember, it’s not necessary to use every tool for a given phase. Instead you should focus on picking the best tool for the problem you are trying to tackle and the composition of your sprint team. We’ll learn more about the tools you can use in the lessons for each phase.
