# Unit Overview

Watch [the unit overview.](https://youtu.be/fcBKmn0d27w)

This unit is for students who are interested in learning how to bring an idea through concept, design, and user validation, as well as creating a spec to handoff to engineering. You’ll learn more about how you can use Design Thinking to diverge in order to explore ideas and then ultimately focus in and converge on a single idea. Equally important is mapping out the full concept and creating a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.

At the end of this unit and after completing your project, you will be able to:

- Organize and run a Design Sprint to create a product that solves a user need
- Create sketches, storyboards, and build interactive prototypes
- Design a research plan to validate product concept and identify usability issues along critical user journeys
- Recruit participants and conduct usability tests following a research plan
- Translate user insights into product improvements

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- What is a Design Sprint
- Identifying the right problems for a Design Sprint
- Planning a Design Sprint
- Working with Designers

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe what a Design Sprint is
- Identify good candidates for a Design Sprint
- Plan a Design Sprint
- Explain the similarities and differences between the Product Manager and Designer roles

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Design Spring | A design thinking based time constrained process to explore and reduce the risk of building new products or features. Design Sprints are most often discussed in the context of product development but can also be applied to internal process improvement |
| Design Thinking | A human centered, iterative approach to solve problems through deeply understanding users and needs, redefining problems, creating innovative solutions, and testing them |
