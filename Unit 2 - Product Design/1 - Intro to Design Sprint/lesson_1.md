# Unit Overview

Watch [the unit overview.](https://youtu.be/fcBKmn0d27w)

This unit is for students who are interested in learning how to bring an idea through concept, design, and user validation, as well as creating a spec to handoff to engineering. You’ll learn more about how you can use Design Thinking to diverge in order to explore ideas and then ultimately focus in and converge on a single idea. Equally important is mapping out the full concept and creating a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.

At the end of this unit and after completing your project, you will be able to:

- Organize and run a Design Sprint to create a product that solves a user need
- Create sketches, storyboards, and build interactive prototypes
- Design a research plan to validate product concept and identify usability issues along critical user journeys
- Recruit participants and conduct usability tests following a research plan
- Translate user insights into product improvements

<br>

Watch [the lesson overview.](https://youtu.be/KLnwxXpKVXw)

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- What is a Design Sprint
- Identifying the right problems for a Design Sprint
- Planning a Design Sprint
- Working with Designers

<br>

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe what a Design Sprint is
- Identify good candidates for a Design Sprint
- Plan a Design Sprint
- Explain the similarities and differences between the Product Manager and Designer roles

<br>

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Design Spring | A design thinking based time constrained process to explore and reduce the risk of building new products or features. Design Sprints are most often discussed in the context of product development but can also be applied to internal process improvement |
| Design Thinking | A human centered, iterative approach to solve problems through deeply understanding users and needs, redefining problems, creating innovative solutions, and testing them |

<br>

# What is a Design Sprint

Watch [What is a Design Sprint?](https://youtu.be/MOLthh86cbQ)

> “A Design Sprint is a time-constrained process that uses design thinking with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market.” -- Wikipedia

A Design Sprint...

- Allows the team to explore and learn without actually building
- Means the process can fail early without serious consequences
- Creates buy-in and ownership among the team

<br>

The Design Sprint process is highly customizable and can be adapted to the specifics of each challenge.

A Design Sprint is a tool that allows you to relatively quickly explore new ideas and validate them. They work best when the sprint team is composed of cross functional members. There’s no one size fits all Design Sprint-- you should tailor it to meet the specific needs of your business, team, and users.

# Phases of a Design Sprint

Watch [the Phases of a Design Sprint.](https://youtu.be/K3yLJNZLJLs)

There are six phases of a Design Sprint.

1. `Understand`
Create a shared understanding of the problem space, the user, the competition, and why it all matters. Align as a team on a focus moving forward for the rest of the sprint

<br>

2. `Define`
Start by focusing on where you want to end. By setting goals you can work backwards to understand what needs to happen in order to get there.

<br>

3. `Sketch`
Ideate. Start diverging and exploring lots of different solutions.

<br>

4. `Decide`
Bring it all back together and decide on one idea to take through prototyping and validation

<br>

5. `Prototype`
Map out and build a prototype of your idea

<br>

6. `Validate`
Check to make sure that your idea is solving a real user need… and that it can be built!

<br>

Each phase has a set of tools that can be used to facilitate reaching the goal of each phase. Remember, it’s not necessary to use every tool for a given phase. Instead you should focus on picking the best tool for the problem you are trying to tackle and the composition of your sprint team. We’ll learn more about the tools you can use in the lessons for each phase.

<br>
<br>

# Design Sprint Outcomes

Watch [the Design Sprint Outcomes.](https://youtu.be/d04iNZ1Rne4)

At the end of a Design Sprint, you’ll have:

- a working prototype for your concept
- insights and validation from users on your concept
- tons of artifacts
- list of other ideas that can be explored

<br>

What happens after a Design Sprint? It really depends… But here are a few possibilities:

- More testing and iteration
- The concept will go to Design to be more fully fleshed out
- The concept will go to Engineering to build
- Make a case with leadership to invest more resources in bringing concept to market
- The concept is abandoned because it doesn’t address a user need
and lots more

<br>

Before the sprint starts, it’s a good practice to plan what the next steps afterward will be. But it’s also important to acknowledge and respond appropriately based on the outcome of the sprint.

<br>
<br>

# Who Should Participate?

Watch [who participates in Design Sprints.](https://youtu.be/xB9dMnHI00k)

Design Sprints are not just for Designers. The best Design Sprints occur when there’s good representation across a number of different functions.

- Want around 6 members on the team
- Members should bring different perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of expertise
- Team typically includes someone from Product, Design, and Engineering - but there’s no hard and fast rule
- Need to find the right people to bring perspective and focus to the current challenge.

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Who Participates?

Set up the Team:

Our Grocery Store Chain is concerned about increased competition from online shopping and delivery services. Let's set up a Design Sprint team to work through this problem.

Which functional areas do you want on your Design Sprint Team? Why?

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Who Participates?

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/VuhxScrqVrc)

Things to Remember
Even though it’s called a Design Sprint-- it’s not just for Designers. The best Design Sprints occur when there is good representation across a number of different functions, like:

- Product
- Design
- Engineering
- Data Science
- Marketing
- Support
- Operations
- Sales
- Privacy
- Legal
- Leadership
- Finance

...and many more.

The most important thing is to put together a team that is well suited to tackle the challenge at hand. You’ll want to identify individuals who can bring perspective and expertise for the given focus.

<br>
<br>

# Is the Problem Right?

Watch [determining if the problem is right.](https://youtu.be/b64M-ZBdOvc)

Design Sprints are great at a lot of things. They bring a team together to focus on solving a problem. Design Sprints are best suited when there are big open questions. They don’t work as well when a solution or in depth direction has already been identified.

Here’s some examples of when a Design Sprint is a good fit:

- New product
- New feature for existing product
- Improvement to existing product
- You need to solve a complex problem
- You don’t already have an answer

<br>

And some examples where a Design Sprint is unlikely to be helpful:

- There is already clear product direction, just not final designs
- There is not enough foundational research to understand user needs
- You already have an answer


<br>

# Planning a Design Sprint

Watch [The Sprint Master.](https://youtu.be/dUybdNulZow)

The Sprint Master...

- Creates the structure of the Sprint
- Selects which methodologies will be used
- Facilitates during the sprint
- Keeps the team focused and on track

<br>

### Your First Sprint

There’s a lot going on during a Sprint, so if possible I would recommend that you get more experience before you lead a Sprint on your own.

Participate in a sprint to really get a better understanding of exactly how they work

Shadow a Sprint Master as they are putting together and planning a Sprint

Co-facilitate a sprint with another experienced Sprint Master

When you have completed all three steps you are ready to facilitate a Design Sprint on your own.

<br>

Watch [planning a design sprint.](https://youtu.be/15zpdvzg4kk)

There’s a lot of work that happens before a Design Sprint even starts to make sure that things go smoothly. Once you have a challenge selected, you can start planning a sprint.

<br>

### Challenge Statement

Creating a challenge statement for a Design Sprint is a great way to help everyone understand the purpose of the sprint. The best challenge statements are:

- Short and easy to understand
- Something with urgency that needs to be delivered
- Contain a timeframe
- Are inspiring and get people excited

<br>

An easy format to follow is:

> [ACTION] + [OUTPUT] + FOR [USER] + TO [PROBLEM] + BY [TIMEFRAME]

<br>

### The Sprint Team

Watch [organizing the sprint team.](https://youtu.be/oTprbm5w_g0)

Sprint Teams are ideally about 6 people.

If more than that, split the group into smaller teams that work through exercises in parallel and then share with the whole group.

You will want to identify people whose work is directly related to the sprint challenge.

<br>

#### Agenda

Build a rough agenda for your sprint.

Select methods for each phase (which we’ll discuss in the following lessons) that will provide insights for the problem you are trying to solve. Keep in mind the composition of your sprint team-- if people are more familiar with the problem space, it likely will make more sense to spend more time on ideation whereas if people are less familiar it would make sense to spend more time on understanding the problem space.

<br>

#### Space

Secure a space for the sprint to take place, preferably somewhere away from distractions.

Tons of space for everyone who is participating.

Whiteboards or lots of wall space for posting stickies.

<br>

#### Supplies

- Post it notes
- Dry erase markers for whiteboard (multiple colors)
- Sharpies
- Pens
- Paper
- Giant post it notes (if no whiteboard)

#### Logistics

Send a calendar invite to the sprint team.

Coordinate getting some light snacks / refreshments for each day.

Arrive earlier to make sure that the room is arranged in a way that is conducive for collaboration (ex: a U shape around a whiteboard).

Send a reminder the day before, with any pre-work that the team needs to do (like reviewing user research or trying competing products).

# Icebreakers

Watch [What are Icebreakers?](https://youtu.be/NMujpkcADw8)

If your Sprint team hasn’t worked together before, it’s a good idea to spend a little bit of time getting the group comfortable with each other. At a minimum, this means that each member should know every other member’s name and role.

It can also be beneficial to do a quick icebreaker exercise, although you won’t want to spend too much time on this -- no more than 20 minutes. These are short exercises designed to get people to open up and connect with others. Two quick icebreakers you can use are:

- `Two truths and a lie` - each team member introduces themselves and includes three facts about themselves. Two of them are true and one is false. The team must figure out which one is false.

- `Superpower` - each team member introduces themselves along with the superpower that they are bringing to the team

<br>

### Practice

Introduce yourself to the team and tell us the superpower you will bring to the Design Sprint.

Write your introduction and include two truths and a lie about yourself.
