# Wrapping it all up

Watch [Wrapping It All Up at the end of a Design Sprint.](https://youtu.be/Jwmdd3if33I)

At the end of a Design Sprint, there are a couple different possible outcomes:

- Move to implementation
- Iterate on the specifics of the prototype
- Run another Design Sprint
- Abandon the idea

<br>

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Iterate | going through the process again in order to make improvements |
| Evangelize | to get people excited and bought into the project |
| PRD | Product Requirements Doc that specifies why we’re building a product, how the product will work, and how the product’s success will be measured. |
| P0 | a launch blocking feature. The product will not launch without it |
| P1 | a nice to have feature at launch, but not required. If not present at launch it should be a fast follow |
| P2 | a desirable feature |

# Why Iterate

Watch [Why Iterate?](https://youtu.be/PhvkK5689h8)

Iteration is an important part of the process that allows you to test and refine your ideas. Iteration can reduce overall risk for a project by getting feedback early on without having to build out the actual product.

Iteration does take time though. And you will never get everything completely perfect. It’s important to focus on getting the things right that will be hard to fix if you reach the wrong conclusion.

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: Iteration reduces risk
</summary>
True! Iteration allows you to discover and mitigate issues before you start building
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: You should continue to iterate until you have the perfect solution</summary>
False - You should iterate until you’ve answered all the big questions, but there will likely be smaller questions you need to move forward without validating.
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Iterating

Exercise: Iterating on our Grocery Store Chain Product

The product we created is pretty good — but we learned during the validation phase that there a few issues that we need to address, both from a usability perspective and a technical feasibility perspective. 

Given what you know about the app, what do you think some of those issues are? How should they be addressed?


<br>
<br>

# Solution: Iterating

Watch [the iteration solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/AgKfndgc3L8)

We’re off to a good start, but there are some areas we need to push harder on:

`Optimizing sign up flow` -- The sign up flow for subscriptions could be better optimized to reduce user confusion around the concept. We also can do a better job articulating the value to users.

`Managing active subscriptions` -- There’s currently no way for users to cancel a subscription. We need to address this before the product can launch

`Prices changes` -- We need to figure out how to handle price changes

# Evangelizing

Watch [Evangelizing.](https://youtu.be/8OZ5JBEwZAo)

At the end of a Design Sprint you will have a number of great artifacts that you can share to explain the problem, process, and approach that the team took. Sharing a summary of the Design Sprint more broadly will help to create buy into the project and the Design Sprint process.

The most powerful artifact you can share will likely be the prototype since it will clear communicate your idea from the perspective of how a user would interact with it

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: Once the Design Sprint is over, your work is complete
</summary>
False - Lots more work to do after the Design Sprint.. But at this point you should know what you are building (or not building)
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: Sharing out your prototype is an effective way to explain your idea and get people excited
</summary>
True - Sharing a prototype is a super effective way to explain your idea through visuals. Usually people will get excited after they click through a prototype.
</details>

# Exercise: Evangelizing

The Design Sprint team has done it! We've designed a great project and now it's time to get buy-in from the rest of our colleagues. We need do some evangelizing!

Put together a plan for how you would evangelize your Grocery Story Chain App product internally and share out key takeaways from the Design Sprint.

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Evangelizing

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/tw1z-CjwAro)

Creating an evangelizing plan is a great way to share what you learned in the Design Sprint. Now that you've made one, go share your team's great product!

# Handoff

Watch [Handoff for Implementation.](https://youtu.be/LBPQO6_W8kg)

A Product Requirement Doc captures the problem the team is trying to solve, the goals of the project, how success will be measured, and the requirements for how features should work along with associated priority.

<br>

A PRD typically has the following sections:

- Background
- Problem
- Goals
- Success metrics
- Features

<br>

For each feature, you'll want to include a priority level:

- `P0` = launch blocker. Product will not launch without this feature
- `P1` = desirable for launch, but not required. Fast follow after launch
- `P2` = nice to have
- `P3`, `P4` = unlikely to get built

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: PRD stands for Problem Resolution Document
</summary>
False - A PRD is a Product Requirements Document.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: P1 features will be included at launch
</summary>
False -  P1 features do not block launch
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Write a PRD

Exercise: Write a PRD for the Grocery Store Chain App

We are now ready to handoff the Grocery Store Chain app we created. Let's write a PRD to share the product with other teams.

- [ ] What do we need to know about the Grocery Store Chain?
- [ ] What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- [ ] What are our goals for the product?
- [ ] How do we measure the product's success?
- [ ] What are the important features of the product? Describe each feature in detail, along with its associated priority


<br>
<br>

# Solution: Write a PRD

View [the solution PRD](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5ea104ed_pmnd-c2-prd-autopilot-1/pmnd-c2-prd-autopilot-1.pdf) or within the repo [here](./pmnd-c2-prd-autopilot-1.pdf).

<br>

The PRD is the most important document that you will create as a Product Manager. It serves as an input to a handful of other teams. There’s a variety of different formats that you can use, but you’ll always want to make sure that you have the following sections:

- Background
- Problem
- Goals
- Success metrics
- Features (including priority)

# Lesson Recap

Watch [the lesson recap.](https://youtu.be/ZNnvbKONHjw)

You’ve reached the end of the Next Steps lesson! We covered the following topics:

- Iteration
- Evangelism
- Handoff and the PRD

At this point, you should be able to:

- Describe benefits of iteration and identify when iteration is appropriate
- Evangelize your idea internally
- Write a PRD describing the features your product needs. The eng team will use this when building the features.

<br>
<br>

# Unit Recap

Watch [the unit recap.](https://youtu.be/7dKw5MSCJVE)

- Create sketches, storyboards, and build interactive prototypes
- Design a research plan to validate product concept and identify usability issues along critical user journeys
- Recruit participants and Conduct usability tests following a research plan
