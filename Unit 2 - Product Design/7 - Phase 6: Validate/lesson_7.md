# Wrapping it all up

Watch [Wrapping It All Up at the end of a Design Sprint.](https://youtu.be/Jwmdd3if33I)

At the end of a Design Sprint, there are a couple different possible outcomes:

- Move to implementation
- Iterate on the specifics of the prototype
- Run another Design Sprint
- Abandon the idea

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Iterate | going through the process again in order to make improvements |
| Evangelize | to get people excited and bought into the project |
| PRD | Product Requirements Doc that specifies why we’re building a product, how the product will work, and how the product’s success will be measured. |
| P0 | a launch blocking feature. The product will not launch without it |
| P1 | a nice to have feature at launch, but not required. If not present at launch it should be a fast follow |
| P2 | a desirable feature |

# Why Iterate

Watch [Why Iterate?](https://youtu.be/PhvkK5689h8)

Iteration is an important part of the process that allows you to test and refine your ideas. Iteration can reduce overall risk for a project by getting feedback early on without having to build out the actual product.

Iteration does take time though. And you will never get everything completely perfect. It’s important to focus on getting the things right that will be hard to fix if you reach the wrong conclusion.

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: Iteration reduces risk
</summary>
True! Iteration allows you to discover and mitigate issues before you start building
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: You should continue to iterate until you have the perfect solution</summary>
False - You should iterate until you’ve answered all the big questions, but there will likely be smaller questions you need to move forward without validating.

# Exercise: Iterating

Exercise: Iterating on our Grocery Store Chain Product

The product we created is pretty good — but we learned during the validation phase that there a few issues that we need to address, both from a usability perspective and a technical feasibility perspective. 

Given what you know about the app, what do you think some of those issues are? How should they be addressed?

# Solution: Iterating

Watch [the iteration solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/AgKfndgc3L8)

We’re off to a good start, but there are some areas we need to push harder on:

`Optimizing sign up flow` -- The sign up flow for subscriptions could be better optimized to reduce user confusion around the concept. We also can do a better job articulating the value to users.

`Managing active subscriptions` -- There’s currently no way for users to cancel a subscription. We need to address this before the product can launch

`Prices changes` -- We need to figure out how to handle price changes
