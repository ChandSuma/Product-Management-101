# SKETCH

Watch [the sketch phase of the design sprint.](https://youtu.be/-WgL7NnXPSI)

The third phase of the Design sprint is sketch. The goal of this phase is to create and explore lots of ideas, sometimes crazy ones! And then start narrowing ideas down to just a few. Those ideas will be explored in more depth through more detailed sketches.

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Sketch phase of the Design sprint
- Sketching basics
- Crazy 8’s
- Solution Sketches

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Sketch phase of the Design Sprint
- Understand basics for how to sketch effectively
- Use the Crazy 8’s method to ideate through sketching
- Use solution sketching to explore an idea in more depth

<br>

# Sketching Tips

Watch [sketching tips](https://youtu.be/5_fdnsYxL-Y).

- Sketching is easier when you have the right tools
- Use placeholders when details aren't necessary to convey meaning
- Annotate your sketch to help others understand it

Tools to have:

- [ ] Thick & thin tipped pens
- [ ] Highlighters in various colors
- [ ] Paper (dotted or graph paper will make it easier to draw straight lines)
- [ ] Ruler or straight edge

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Sketching Practice

Now that you've got the tools you need, it's time to create a practice sketch. It shouldn't be detailed or beautiful — it just needs to highlight the important features of the app. Don't spend more than 15 minutes on this.

Sketch your Favorite App: use the tools you have gathered to make a quick sketch

- [ ] Choose your favorite app
- [ ] Draw a rectangle to represent the screen
- [ ] Use other shapes to represent text, images, and buttons on the screen
- [ ] Annotate the drawing to help others understand the important features of the app

# Crazy 8's

Watch [Crazy 8 Sketching.](https://youtu.be/RO2590mO8dc)

- 8 sketches in 8 minutes
- 1 sketch per minute
- Quantity over quality (of sketching & idea)

Leverage the shared understanding from Phase 1 and the outcomes you defined in Phase 2 as a jumping off point for your sketches.

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: You should spend 8 minutes per sketch for this exercise</summary>
False. These sketches are supposed to be super quick. You should spend about 1 minute per sketch.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: All 8 sketches need to be high quality sketches and compelling ideas</summary>
False - The goal is to optimize for quantity over quality. It’s ok if not every sketch is super compelling
</details>

# Exercise: Crazy 8's

Exercise: Crazy 8's for the Grocery Store Chain App

We've defined the issues for our Grocery Store Chain product and now it's time to start thinking of solutions. Let's get sketching.

Create 8 Quick Sketches

- [ ] Take a piece of paper and fold it into 8 sections
- [ ] Set a timer on repeat for 1 minute
- [ ] Start sketching
- [ ] When the timer goes off, it's time to move to the next sketch
- [ ] Stop once you've completed 8 sketches

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Crazy 8's

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/ZciN5p9bfIQ)

- Give each sprint member a sheet of paper
- Ask everyone to fold the piece of paper so that it has 8 sections, 1 section for each sketch
- Set a timer on repeat for 1 minute. When it goes off, it’s time to start the next sketch
- After 8 minutes, each team member will have 8 sketches of different ideas

Crazy 8’s is a method to quickly sketch out a lot of different ideas. The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible in a short period of time, without worrying about the quality of the sketch or whether it’s a good or bad idea. Both of those things will be addressed in the remaining concepts of this lesson
