# SKETCH

Watch [the sketch phase of the design sprint.](https://youtu.be/-WgL7NnXPSI)

The third phase of the Design sprint is sketch. The goal of this phase is to create and explore lots of ideas, sometimes crazy ones! And then start narrowing ideas down to just a few. Those ideas will be explored in more depth through more detailed sketches.

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Sketch phase of the Design sprint
- Sketching basics
- Crazy 8’s
- Solution Sketches

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Sketch phase of the Design Sprint
- Understand basics for how to sketch effectively
- Use the Crazy 8’s method to ideate through sketching
- Use solution sketching to explore an idea in more depth

# Sketching Tips

Watch [sketching tips](https://youtu.be/5_fdnsYxL-Y).

- Sketching is easier when you have the right tools
- Use placeholders when details aren't necessary to convey meaning
- Annotate your sketch to help others understand it

Tools to have:

- [ ] Thick & thin tipped pens
- [ ] Highlighters in various colors
- [ ] Paper (dotted or graph paper will make it easier to draw straight lines)
- [ ] Ruler or straight edge

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Sketching Practice

Now that you've got the tools you need, it's time to create a practice sketch. It shouldn't be detailed or beautiful — it just needs to highlight the important features of the app. Don't spend more than 15 minutes on this.

Sketch your Favorite App: use the tools you have gathered to make a quick sketch

- [ ] Choose your favorite app
- [ ] Draw a rectangle to represent the screen
- [ ] Use other shapes to represent text, images, and buttons on the screen
- [ ] Annotate the drawing to help others understand the important features of the app
