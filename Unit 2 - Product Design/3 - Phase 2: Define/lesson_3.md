# SKETCH

Watch [the sketch phase of the design sprint.](https://youtu.be/-WgL7NnXPSI)

The third phase of the Design sprint is sketch. The goal of this phase is to create and explore lots of ideas, sometimes crazy ones! And then start narrowing ideas down to just a few. Those ideas will be explored in more depth through more detailed sketches.

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Sketch phase of the Design sprint
- Sketching basics
- Crazy 8’s
- Solution Sketches

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Sketch phase of the Design Sprint
- Understand basics for how to sketch effectively
- Use the Crazy 8’s method to ideate through sketching
- Use solution sketching to explore an idea in more depth

<br>

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Crazy 8's | a sketching activity that will quickly generate a lot of ideas. |
| Solution Sketch | a high quality sketch that illustrates how a user interacts with the product to achieve their goal |

# Sketching Tips

Watch [sketching tips](https://youtu.be/5_fdnsYxL-Y).

- Sketching is easier when you have the right tools
- Use placeholders when details aren't necessary to convey meaning
- Annotate your sketch to help others understand it

Tools to have:

- [ ] Thick & thin tipped pens
- [ ] Highlighters in various colors
- [ ] Paper (dotted or graph paper will make it easier to draw straight lines)
- [ ] Ruler or straight edge

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Sketching Practice

Now that you've got the tools you need, it's time to create a practice sketch. It shouldn't be detailed or beautiful — it just needs to highlight the important features of the app. Don't spend more than 15 minutes on this.

Sketch your Favorite App: use the tools you have gathered to make a quick sketch

- [ ] Choose your favorite app
- [ ] Draw a rectangle to represent the screen
- [ ] Use other shapes to represent text, images, and buttons on the screen
- [ ] Annotate the drawing to help others understand the important features of the app

# Crazy 8's

Watch [Crazy 8 Sketching.](https://youtu.be/RO2590mO8dc)

- 8 sketches in 8 minutes
- 1 sketch per minute
- Quantity over quality (of sketching & idea)

Leverage the shared understanding from Phase 1 and the outcomes you defined in Phase 2 as a jumping off point for your sketches.

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: You should spend 8 minutes per sketch for this exercise</summary>
False. These sketches are supposed to be super quick. You should spend about 1 minute per sketch.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: All 8 sketches need to be high quality sketches and compelling ideas</summary>
False - The goal is to optimize for quantity over quality. It’s ok if not every sketch is super compelling
</details>

# Exercise: Crazy 8's

Exercise: Crazy 8's for the Grocery Store Chain App

We've defined the issues for our Grocery Store Chain product and now it's time to start thinking of solutions. Let's get sketching.

Create 8 Quick Sketches

- [ ] Take a piece of paper and fold it into 8 sections
- [ ] Set a timer on repeat for 1 minute
- [ ] Start sketching
- [ ] When the timer goes off, it's time to move to the next sketch
- [ ] Stop once you've completed 8 sketches

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Crazy 8's

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/ZciN5p9bfIQ)

- Give each sprint member a sheet of paper
- Ask everyone to fold the piece of paper so that it has 8 sections, 1 section for each sketch
- Set a timer on repeat for 1 minute. When it goes off, it’s time to start the next sketch
- After 8 minutes, each team member will have 8 sketches of different ideas

Crazy 8’s is a method to quickly sketch out a lot of different ideas. The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible in a short period of time, without worrying about the quality of the sketch or whether it’s a good or bad idea. Both of those things will be addressed in the remaining concepts of this lesson

# Voting

Watch [voting.](https://youtu.be/s8j9OC5-gVI)

- Ask each team member to post their sketches and briefly explain each sketch
- After all sketches have been posted, give each team member 3 dot stickers
- Ask everyone to vote for their favorite ideas by placing a dot sticker on the sketch

<details>
<summary>Which of the following are valid ways to vote with your 3 dot vote stickers? <br>
- 1 sticker on sketch A, 1 sticker on sketch B and 1 sticker on sketch C <br>
- 2 stickers on sketch A and 1 sticker on sketch C <br>
- 3 stickers on sketch B
</summary>
These are all valid choices. There are no hard rules about how you can distribute your votes.
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Voting

Voting for the Grocery Store Chain App

We've got some sketches, now it's time to vote on which ideas we would like to develop further. In a real Design Sprint you'd do this with a team so if you can find some friends to help you, invite them to vote too. Just make sure you prepare them by sharing the insights the team has gained from the earlier phases of the Sprint.

How would you distribute your three votes across the 16 sketches (your Crazy 8 and the 8 sketches)? Why?

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Voting

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/8FkYqz4P1Sw)

After all sketches have been shared, giving 3 dot stickers to each team member and asking them to put the stickers on their favorite sketches is a quick way to a visual representation of how the team is feeling about the different ideas being discussed.

<br>
<br>

# Solution Sketch

Watch [Solution Sketching.](https://youtu.be/qwqg4cvSbUc)

- Each sprint member should pick one idea and sketch it out in more detail
- Your solution sketch should contain at least 3 frames that show progression through different states
- You can use words, colors, pictures as needed to help reinforce your idea

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: A Solution Sketch should highlight 3 different ideas
</summary>
False. A Solution Sketch should depict a single idea. However it should contain at least 3 frames that show the idea in a progression of different states
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: Solution Sketches should be quick
</summary>
False. Solution Sketches are more detailed and will take longer to complete. You should optimize for the quality of your sketch
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Solution Sketch

Exercise: Grocery Store Chain Product Solution Sketch

Let's take the best idea from the Crazy 8's exercise and turn it into a more detailed sketch.

Create a more detailed sketch that expands on the ideas in the Crazy 8's sketch.

- [ ] Select the most promising sketch from the Grocery Store Chain Crazy 8's Exercise
- [ ] Spend 30 minutes creating a detailed sketch
- [ ] Include at least three frames to show a user's progression
- [ ] Add annotations as needed

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Solution Sketch

Watch [the solution sketch walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/8u9MtRkbONg)

Solution sketching is a way to explore ideas in more depth. A solution sketch should be high quality and will take more time to complete. It should also include at least 3 frames that show how a user navigate through and interact with the concept.

Solution sketches other people to better understand the specifics of the idea, but also starts to stress test the idea to see how it may or may not work well. Once you start sketching a solution out in more detail you may realize there might be more things required than what you originally thought.
