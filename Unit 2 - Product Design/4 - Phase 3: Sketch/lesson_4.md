# DECIDE

Watch [phase 4: Decide.](https://youtu.be/PVPQj9w5oAg)

Lots of ideas! And it’s now time to pick the best one. We’ll cover a couple different ways that you can start to converge on a single idea to prototype and test.

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Decide phase of the Design Sprint
- Assumptions & Questions
- Decision Matrix
- Thinking Hats

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Decide phase of the Design Sprint
- Articulate assumptions behind ideas and question them
- Create a Decision Matrix
- Represent perspectives from a wider audience

<br>

# Assumptions & Questions

Watch [Assumptions & Questions.](https://youtu.be/RQ5wba2E2IY)

Questioning assumptions is a good way to make sure that you don’t get stuck in a specific way of thinking

It’s easiest to start by identifying assumptions, and then drilling down and asking questions to see if those assumptions still stand

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or False: Questioning assumptions will always lead to alternative, innovative ideas.</summary>
False - Not always. Often times you will find false assumptions, it’s not always guaranteed to happen.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Think about [Spectacles by Snapchat](https://www.spectacles.com/) (sunglasses with a camera and Snapchat integration). Write an assumption that the product made</summary>
Good examples could include assumptions related to privacy, for example, “People don’t mind being recorded”
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Now turn that assumption into a question
</summary>
A good question should challenge the assumption from the previous quiz, for example “Are bystanders comfortable with their image being captured without their knowledge” or “Will people interact or feel different when talking to someone who is wearing a camera on their face?”
</details>

<br>
<br>

# Exercise: Assumptions & Questions

Exercise: Grocery Store Chain App Assumptions and Questions
Let's take a closer look at your Grocery Store Chain product Solution Sketch -- or you can look at my Autopilot Solution Sketch below.

What assumptions did you make? How can you turn those assumptions into questions?

Look carefully at the Autopilot Sketch. What assumptions does it make?

Re-write the assumptions you identified above as questions


<br>
<br>

# Solution: Assumptions & Questions

Watch [the solution video.](https://youtu.be/VzDJD_BeKsU)

Questioning assumptions is a good way to make sure that you are exploring all angles of a solution.

A sample response might look like...

<br>

| Assumptions | Questions |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Consumers buy the same items | Do consumers buy the same items? Are there factors that affect item choice (ie: will some people just buy what’s cheapest) |
| Consumers buy some items on a regular cadence | What factors affect how often consumers purchase an item? |
| Consumers are comfortable with a set it and forget it type of subscription for some types of goods | Are consumers comfortable with a subscription? What types of goods would consumers be comfortable subscribing to? |

# Decision Matrix

Watch [Decision Matrix.](https://youtu.be/feTebgZqKA0)

A decision matrix allows you to visualize the trade offs between different ideas when comparing across two criteria.

Ideas generally worth pursuing will be high value & low effort or high value & high effort

Ideas that are low value & high effort are generally not worth pursuing unless value increases or effort decreases in the future

Ideas that may not make sense to pursue now, may be worth pursuing later if the value of the idea increase or the effort to pursue the idea decreases

<br>

<details>
<summary>Which ideas are worth pursuing?</summary>
High value/high effort and high value/low effort ideas are the best ideas to pursue
</details>

<br>

![Sample Decision Matrix](./Sample_Decision_Matrix.png)

<br>

<details>
<summary>Which of the ideas in the above matrix is the best one to move forward with in the Design Sprint?</summary>
B! B provides a lot of user value, as well as a decent amount of effort (which means it will be harder for others to duplicate)

<br>

D might sometimes be correct if resources are tight because D provides high user value and not much effort. The downside is that low effort ideas can also be duplicated by others quickly.

<br>

Even though C doesn’t require much effort, it does not provide much user value. And A doesn't provide much value _and_ is a lot of effort.

</details>

<br>

Decision Matrix Practice

In the next two quizzes we will consider four different product ideas.

- A feature that screens calls from suspected scammers
- An app that alerts you when your shoelaces are untied
- A feature that allows you to unsend an email up to one minute after you sent it.
- An app that lets you play 10 different animal sounds

<br>

<details>
<summary>How would you categorize the four product ideas?</summary>

| Idea | Value & Effort |
| ---- | -------------- |
| A feature that screens calls from suspected scammers | High value, High effort |
| An app that alerts you when your shoelaces are untied | Low value, High effort |
| A feature that allows you to unsend an email up to one minute after you sent it. | High value, Low effort |
| An app that lets you play 10 different animal sounds | Low value, Low effort |
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Which of these four ideas should the team pursue? Why?</summary>
There are two ideas that I’d recommend the team look into...

The first is the unsend idea. Have you ever wanted to unsend an email right you sent it because you noticed a typo or remembered something else you wanted to include? I know I have… There’s a lot of value in this feature and likely you could use a simple timer to delay sending so that users have a chance to “unsend”. 

The second is the call screening idea. Spam calls are a huge annoyance! Screening spam calls is a hard problem to solve but there’s a ton of user value if it can figure out how to do it right.

# Exercise: Decision Matrix

Exercise: Grocery Store Decision Matrix

Let's apply the Decision Matrix tool to the Grocery Store ideas. You can use your own ideas, use my ideas from the Crazy 8's sketches below, or come up with some completely new ideas.

Create a Decision Matrix to explore ideas for the Grocery Store Chain app

- [ ] Create a 2x2 Decision Matrix table
- [ ] Label the x-axis "User Effort"
- [ ] Label the y-axis "Effort"
- [ ] Pick 3 ideas for the Grocery Store Chain app and write each on a sticky note
- [ ] On each sticky, add a short explanation of the value and an estimate of the effort including rationale 
- [ ] Place each idea in a quadrant
- [ ] Circle the ideas that are worth pursuing

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Decision Matrix

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/z3BiUc9f_98)

<br>

![The Decision Matrix Solution](./Decision_Matrix_Solution.png)

<br>

A decision matrix is a visual tool that allows you to sort and compare things across a set of criteria.

- Draw a matrix on a white board and label your axes
- Write each idea onto a sticky note
- For each idea, have a short discussion on which is the appropriate quadrant
- Then place the sticky note into the appropriate quadrant

# Thinking Hats

Watch [Thinking Hats.](https://youtu.be/l6fHwyH0hqE)

The Thinking Hats exercise allows you to make sure that different perspectives are being discussed and pushes people to be open to different perspectives since everyone will have to represent multiple, differing views..

The team discussion focuses on one hat at a time. The order can vary, but you'll want to start and end with the blue hat (process). This order works well when comparing ideas:

> Blue hat - process (align on goals and order of hats)
>
> White hat - data
>
> Green hat - creativity
>
> Yellow hat - benefits
>
> Black hat - judgment
>
> Red hat - intuition
>
> Blue hat - process (summary of discussion)

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or false: You must wear a hat that matches your own view
</summary>
False. It’s not required that your personal view matches the hat you wear. It can actually be very beneficial to have to argue from a perspective different than your own.
</details>

# Exercise: Thinking Hats

Exercise: Grocery Store Chain App Thinking Hats

In this exercise we are going to look at some of our ideas for the Grocery Store using different hats. Pick one of these ideas -- or use one of your own.

Put on the blue hat. How would you structure the conversation? What are the goals?

Now put on the white hat. What do we know? What do we need to find out?

Now put on the green hat. What are new views? Or some alternative solutions?

Now put on the yellow hat. For each idea, what are the benefits? How would you advocate for each one?

Now put on the black hat. For each idea what are the challenges or things that could go wrong?

Now put on the red hat. How are you feeling about each idea?

Now put on the blue hat back on. How would you summarize the overall conversation and viewpoints discussed? Which idea makes the most sense to pursue?

<br>
<br>

# Solution: Thinking Hats

Watch [the solution walkthrough, part one.](https://youtu.be/9Spw921H9LQ)
Watch [the solution walkthrough, part two.](https://youtu.be/zPVl4oyMBfc)
Watch [the solution walkthrough, part three.](https://youtu.be/OwgCwiC2Jww)

### Blue Hat - Process
What goal do we want to pursue?
What sequence for the hats?

<br>

### White Hat - Data
We know:
- Consumers visit grocery stores ~1.6x week
- The average consumer spends 30 minutes in our store each visit (not including travel time) and purchases 13 items
- Our stores each carry around 50k items

<br>

### Green Hat - Creativity
Digital vs. in store experiences
What should the interaction of purchasing an item look like?

<br>

### Yellow Hat - Benefits
Navigate:
- Makes it super easy to find items in the store
- High tech factor
- Similar to getting driving directions

Suggestions:
- Can be super helpful to surface products consumers will enjoy
- Helps if consumers forgot a specific product
- Super simple and lightweight interaction

Autopilot
- Removes the need for consumers to create/manage shopping lists
- Options for store pick up or delivery
- Flexible re-ordering that has the potential to be based on purchase data

<br>

### Black Hat - Judgment
Navigate:
- Really hard to do well
- Overkill
- Many people won’t want to have an app open in order to navigate through a store

Suggestions:
- This would really only work for online purchases
- Do we have enough data to build this in a meaningful way?

Autopilot
- Are consumers comfortable giving up this much control?
- What if pricing increases for an item? But the item is still auto-purchased?
- Giving choices between schedules and pick up/delivery creates additional complexity

<br>

### Red Hat - Intuition
- Navigation seems cool, but not sure we could execute on this with high quality
- Suggestions makes sense and seems like there’s little downside
- Autopilot seems the most exciting and has the opportunity to transform our business

<br>

### Blue Hat - Process
Move forward with Autopilot!

<br>

Thinking hats is a method that allows you to make sure other perspectives are being represented and discussed when deciding on which idea to move forward to prototyping
