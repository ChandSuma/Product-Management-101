# DECIDE

Watch [phase 4: Decide.](https://youtu.be/PVPQj9w5oAg)

Lots of ideas! And it’s now time to pick the best one. We’ll cover a couple different ways that you can start to converge on a single idea to prototype and test.

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Decide phase of the Design Sprint
- Assumptions & Questions
- Decision Matrix
- Thinking Hats

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Decide phase of the Design Sprint
- Articulate assumptions behind ideas and question them
- Create a Decision Matrix
- Represent perspectives from a wider audience

<br>

# Assumptions & Questions

Watch [Assumptions & Questions.](https://youtu.be/RQ5wba2E2IY)

Questioning assumptions is a good way to make sure that you don’t get stuck in a specific way of thinking

It’s easiest to start by identifying assumptions, and then drilling down and asking questions to see if those assumptions still stand

<br>

<details>
<summary>True or False: Questioning assumptions will always lead to alternative, innovative ideas.</summary>
False - Not always. Often times you will find false assumptions, it’s not always guaranteed to happen.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Think about [Spectacles by Snapchat](https://www.spectacles.com/) (sunglasses with a camera and Snapchat integration). Write an assumption that the product made</summary>
Good examples could include assumptions related to privacy, for example, “People don’t mind being recorded”
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Now turn that assumption into a question
</summary>
A good question should challenge the assumption from the previous quiz, for example “Are bystanders comfortable with their image being captured without their knowledge” or “Will people interact or feel different when talking to someone who is wearing a camera on their face?”
</details>

# Exercise: Assumptions & Questions

Exercise: Grocery Store Chain App Assumptions and Questions
Let's take a closer look at your Grocery Store Chain product Solution Sketch -- or you can look at my Autopilot Solution Sketch below.

What assumptions did you make? How can you turn those assumptions into questions?

Look carefully at the Autopilot Sketch. What assumptions does it make?

Re-write the assumptions you identified above as questions

# Solution: Assumptions & Questions

Watch [the solution video.](https://youtu.be/VzDJD_BeKsU)

Questioning assumptions is a good way to make sure that you are exploring all angles of a solution.

A sample response might look like...

<br>

| Assumptions | Questions |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Consumers buy the same items | Do consumers buy the same items? Are there factors that affect item choice (ie: will some people just buy what’s cheapest) |
| Consumers buy some items on a regular cadence | What factors affect how often consumers purchase an item? |
| Consumers are comfortable with a set it and forget it type of subscription for some types of goods | Are consumers comfortable with a subscription? What types of goods would consumers be comfortable subscribing to? |
