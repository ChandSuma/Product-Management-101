# Validate

Watch [Phase 6: Validate.](https://youtu.be/1tXuJDuBhEA)

Validation is a super important part of the Design Sprint process. It allows you to test your ideas and get feedback without having to invest in fully building out the idea. You’ll validate your idea by talking directly to your target users to learn more about them and then ask them to try out your prototype and provide feedback.

In addition to getting feedback from users, it’s also important to validate that your idea can actually be built by the engineering team in a reasonable amount of time.

<br>

In this lesson, we’ll cover the following topics:

- The Validate phase of the Design sprint
- Planning for a user study
- Structure of a user study
- Technical feasibility

At the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the Validate phase of the Design Sprint
- Plan for a user study
- Run a user study and interview users
- Have a feasibility discussion with an engineer

# Planning a User Study

Watch [Planning a User Study.](https://youtu.be/9qRmndcCxVU)

When planning for a user study, you’ll want to think through these things beforehand:

- Who is your target user?
- How many interviews will you have?
- What do you want to find out?
- Background information about the user
- Specific questions around your idea
- Tasks to complete with a prototype
- How much time you will need to complete each interview


Create a research plan to make sure that you are tracking all these pieces of information and capturing all the questions you want to ask.

<br>

<details>
<summary>What are examples of attributes you can consider when selecting your target users to interview?</summary>

- New user vs. existing user
- Age
- Hometown
- Android or iOS phone
- Household income
- Gender
- Number of tweets within the last week
- Number of online purchases completed in the last month

All of these are attributes that you can consider when selecting users to interview. Remember, the attributes you use will be highly related to the prototype that you want to test. It’s important to identify attributes that can be used to identify your target user.

- Identifies the target user for the interview
- Identifies the key questions that need to be answered
- Lays out an interview script containing the specific questions and order they will be asked in

# Exercise: User Study Plan

Write a Research Plan for the Grocery Store Chain App

We need to talk to target users about our product. Let's start writing up a Research Plan to make that happen. In this exercise we'll focus on setting up the study. We'll work on the actual interview questions in the next exercise.

Prepare for your user study by writing up the basic structure in our Research Plan:

- [ ] What do you want to find out?
- [ ] Who are the target users you want to interview?
- [ ] How many interviews do you want to conduct?
- [ ] How long should each interview take?

# Solution: User Study Plan

Watch [the solution walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/v45DC1RP6qQ)

Target Users:

- Split between power shoppers and casual shoppers
- Split between one person households and multi-person households
- Slightly skewed towards people who have not purchased groceries online in the last 30 days Number of Interviews: 7 x 60 minutes Research Objectives (the questions we want to answer):
- Have you ever shopped for groceries online?
- What was that experience like?
- Are there specific items you wouldn’t consider purchasing online?
- How would you feel about groceries being automatically ordered for you?
- Are there any concerns that you would have?

<br>

A lot of work goes into running a user study before the interview even starts! It will be important to correctly identify and invite your target users to participate in the interview. 

At the same time, it’s also important that you identify clear questions that you hope to answer through the study, along with the more specific questions you will ask the user in order to answer the larger overarching question.
