# Introduction

Watch [the Unit 2 Project Overview](https://youtu.be/UJMaWn_vkzM)

For this project, you will be running a Design Sprint to further develop a concept to address the opportunity that you identified in the previous course. There are six phases of the Design Sprint. For this project there will also be two additional steps-- one for iterating based on findings from user testing and one to prepare your concept for handoff.

Generally a Design Sprint is a cross functional exercise with team members participating from a number of different roles across your company (Design, Product, Eng, Marketing, etc). However, in order to allow flexibility for you to complete this project on your own timeline, you’ll be going through this Design Sprint on your own.

# Detailed Instructions

A Design Sprint is a cross-functional exercise with team members participating from a number of different roles across your company (Design, Product, Eng, Marketing, etc).

In this Design Sprint project, you’ll be going through the exercises on your own and we will simulate some of the group activities related to brainstorming.

<br>
<br>

# 0. Set the Stage
You will start a PRD that can be shared with the team to set the stage about why this problem matters. The first part of the PRD will include:

- [ ] Any relevant background information
- [ ] A problem statement which communicates the scope of the problem
- [ ] Initial goals, which can continue to evolve throughout the project

<br>
<br>

# 1. Understand
Create a shared understanding of the problem space and identify opportunities through a “How Might We” exercise.

1. Create at least 20 virtual stickies that ask questions following the "How Might We" model

- [ ] Opportunities. Not solutions.
- [ ] Not too broad, and not too narrow
- [ ] One idea per sticky

2. Get input from other members of your digital "team"

- [ ] Open the Google Slides deck that corresponds with your project
- [ ] Copy three slides back into your deck

3. Sort and group the stickies

- [ ] Place any stickies that do not follow the "How Might We" model into an "other" cluster
- [ ] Group similar stickies together into clusters and label each cluster
- [ ] Group similar clusters together into themes -- one per slide -- and label the title of the slide with the theme

4. Pick one theme that you want to move forward with and explain your rationale for selecting that theme

<br>
<br>

# 2. Define

By defining and focusing on the desired outcomes, you’ll be able to more clearly understand how to get there.

1. Define success metrics - Identify goals along with the signals and metrics that can be used to measure them using the HEART framework. This will be helpful later on, as you’ve already outlined what your project needs to do in order to be successful.

- [ ] Start by identifying at least two user-centered goals
- [ ] Then identify what signals from user behavior will affect reaching each specific goal
- [ ] Finally, create metrics derived from those signals can be measured

2. Write a future press review

Think about how you want users to respond to your product:
- [ ] Who is it for?
- [ ] What problem does it solve?
- [ ] How does it change a customer’s life?
- [ ] Why should customers love it?

Use that information to draft a review from the perspective of the user

<br>
<br>

# 3. Sketch
Generate ideas for possible solutions based on the theme that you selected.

1. Create 8 quick sketches to quickly generate a few ideas.

- [ ] Take a sheet of paper and fold it into 8 sections
- [ ] Sketch an idea in each of the 8 sections
- [ ] Spend about 1-2 minutes per sketch

2. Pick two to develop into more detailed flows that clarify how the solution would work.

- [ ] Spend about 30 minutes per sketch
- [ ] Sketch your idea in more detail than the last exercise -- use text annotations if needed
- [ ] Create at least 3 frames that show how the user progresses through the flow
- [ ] Include a title

<br>
<br>

# 4. Decide

Pick the final concept that you want to develop into a prototype

- [ ] Pick your most compelling solution sketch
- [ ] Explain why it’s the most compelling

<br>
<br>

# 5. Prototype

Turn your concept into a realistic, interactive prototype that you will use to validate your assumptions and ideas

1. Storyboard - Create a storyboard based on your best solution sketch. We’ll use the storyboard as the blueprint to create the prototype.

The storyboard should:

- [ ] Be high fidelity enough to build a prototype:
- [ ] Detail the steps a user goes through and how they progress from one step to the next
- [ ] Detail the layout of the software experience (wireframe level detail)

- [ ] Cover the entire user journey (ie: things that can happen outside the software experience)
- [ ] What prompts the user to use this?

2. Prototype - Create an interactive prototype to showcase your concept

- [ ] Create mocks based on your storyboard using the [Figma prototyping tool](https://www.figma.com/prototyping/)
- [ ] Use the prototype tool to define the flows
- [ ] Describe the concept that your prototype captures
- [ ] Describe the flows/tasks a user can complete in your prototype

<br>
<br>

# 6. Validate

Users will go through your prototype and provide feedback on your concept. This is also an opportunity to have an engineering feasibility discussion

1. Create a Research Plan
- [ ] Create a research plan
- [ ] Identify your target user
- [ ] Map out the flow of the interview
    - [ ] Intro
    - [ ] Background information
    - [ ] Tasks
    - [ ] Wrap Up

<br>

2. Run User Studies - Inviting users in to participate in studies is a great way to get feedback if you are on the right track. Additionally, it’s also easier to course correct at this point before any code has been written. We’re going to invite 2 users to try out the prototype that you built. You’ll use the research plan you created to guide the study and will record the audio from the session. You should also plan to take notes during the session.

- [ ] Schedule two meetings with people you can interview about your prototype
    Note: It might not be possible to find someone who meets your target user criteria-- and that’s ok for the sake of this exercise

- [ ] Run through your interview script in the research plan.
    You will ask some background questions to the participant and then ask them to complete several tasks

- [ ] Make sure to take notes during the interview (you can use the research plan as a template for notes)
- [ ] You should record the audio of the interview
- [ ] You should plan to spend about 30 minutes per interview

<br>

3. Prepare for a feasibility conversation - Now that you’ve created an interactive prototype of your concept, it’s important to make sure that it can actually be built. Engage with engineering early on, to make sure you understand the tradeoffs of how design decisions can impact timelines. Prepare to have a feasibility conversation with your engineering team or lead.

- [ ] Map out dynamic elements that are displayed in your UI
    - [ ] Identify where you assume the underlying data is coming from
    - [ ] List questions you have around these assumptions

- [ ] Map out what data you collect from your users (ie: text input field) and how it will be used
    - [ ] Identify where you assume this data is being stored
    - [ ] List questions you have around these assumptions

- [ ] Map out your expectations around latency
    - [ ] Identify things that you think might increase latency
    - [ ] List questions you have around these assumptions

<br>
<br>

# 7. Iterate

Leverage learnings from your first two user interviews to make changes to your prototype. Then run another round of user interviews.

1. Course correct

- [ ] Pick the top two issues that you identified in the previous user interviews
- [ ] Explain your rationale for wanting to address those two issues
- [ ] Update your Figma file to address those two issues

<br>

2. More user studies

- [ ] Schedule one meeting with people you can interview about your prototype (not the same people as before)
    - [ ] Note: It might not be possible to someone who meets your target user criteria-- and that’s ok for the sake of this exercise

- [ ] Run through your interview script in the research plan.
    - [ ] You will ask some background questions to the participant and then ask them to complete several tasks

- [ ] Make sure to take notes during the interview (you can use the research plan as a template for notes)
    - [ ] You should record the audio of the interview
    - [ ] You should plan to spend about 30 minutes per interview

<br>
<br>

# 8. Handoff

- [ ] Refine the problem and goals section (if needed)
- [ ] Complete the Key Features and Scope section
- [ ] Link your mocks to the PRD

<br>
<br>

# Product Scenarios to Choose from:

| Company | New Product Idea |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Kaiser Permanente Project | Kaiser Permanente is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes. |
| DoorDash Project | Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required. Your team has been tasked with building a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting) |
| Amazon Project | Amazon is the world leader in self-publishing for books. They would now like to explore entering into another self-publishing media vertical and are considering either self-published videos or self-published music. |
| LinkedIn | LinkedIn is trying to expand its job market offerings by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences |
