# Listening

- More than just listening
- Being an engaged listener
- Fully understanding other points of views
- Not imposing your own views

<br>

Tips for active listening:

- Make eye contact and smile
- Provide encouragement
- Don’t interrupt
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Paraphrase

<br>

Identify 2 friends or colleagues that you could have a short 15 minute conversation with. 

Pick a topic and really try to understand their point of view on it. Practice your active listening skills to see if you can understand their perspective as if it were your own

<br>

# Storytelling

Watch [What is storytelling?](https://youtu.be/S52zhLD1Sxo)

PMs are storytellers. Stories allow you to express your vision and thoughts through more compelling, tangible narratives. Storytelling makes it easier for people to understand and relate to what you are explaining.

<br>

The elements of a story are...
 
- `Hero:` 

- `Goal:` 

- `Villain:` 

- `Sidekick:` 

- `Plot:` 

<br>

Watch [How to Build a Story.](https://youtu.be/cjj_mobCAVE)

Key things to keep in mind when building stories:

- Focus on the problem from the hero’s perspective
- Start by writing the ending first
- The more personal and relatable the story, the more memorable it will be, and the more engaged the audience will be.
- Details and specifics make the story feel more real

<br>
<br>

Fill in the following table:

| Element | Definition |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Hero | ? |
| Goal | ? |
| Villain | ? |
| Sidekick | ? |
| Plot | ? |

<br>

<details>
<summary> The solution table is... </summary>

| Element | Definition |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Hero | The main character - your user |
| Goal | What the user is trying to accomplish |
| Villain | The problem that is preventing the user from reaching their goal |
| Sidekick | A companion that helps the hero reach their goal -- your product |
| Plot | A detailed account of how the hero and the sidekick defeat their villain and read their goal |

# Persuasive Messages

Watch [Being Persuasive.](https://youtu.be/fs3agHWuTFE)

Persuasion is important because you work with lots of people and need to align the team needs to be aligned-- but you don’t have direct authority over everyone. Instead you have to convince them!

- `Ethos: Credibility:` 

- `Logos: Logic:` 

- `Pathos: Emotion:` 

<br>

<details>
<summary> True or false: When objections arise you should address them as quickly as possible and then move on to your next point. </summary>

False! You should address objections without being rushed to really understand the viewpoint and its merits. 

This will also help you to build credibility with the audience-- showing that you care about their opinion and are interested in getting to the best solution.

# Presentations

Watch [Why Presentations Matter.](https://youtu.be/dx3rd6Ngve0)

As a PM, you will need to be constantly communicating and presentations are a great tool to share your ideas. But it’s important to learn how to create presentations that can effectively communicate your message.

### Presentation Structure

- `Introduction: “This is what I’m going to tell you”` and background info


- `Body: “This is what we’re here to talk about”`

- `Conclusion: “This is what I just told you”` and next steps

<br>

### Slide Layout

- `Keep slides simple:`

- `One takeaway per slide:`

- `Limit the amount of text on each slide (no paragraphs):`

- `Use visuals carefully:`

<br>
<br>

Watch [Presenting Tips.](https://youtu.be/NSnc6KDbIlQ)

- `Presentation needs to stand on its own:` 

- `Rehearse:` 

- `Pre-brief key stakeholders before big presentations:` 

<br>

<details>
<summary> True or false: It’s better to have lots of slides with less information than a few slides with tons of information. </summary>
True - you want to make sure that there’s one key point per slide, which means that you might end up with a lot of slides instead of a few slides with many key points.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary> True or false: You should use lots of animations and transition effects in presentations in order to keep people’s attention. </summary>
False - you want to use animations and transition effects carefully to make sure that they are adding to helping to express your idea-- not to make your presentation look more interesting
</details>

<br>

2. Engineers have been ready to start working on a new feature for your product. However, the UX designs aren’t finalized and the designer wants to spend more time revising and iterating. However, both you and the engineers think that the designs look fine. What do you do?

<br>

3. You and a counterpart PM both have a large P0 feature that needs to be delivered. However, between the two of you and your teams you’ll only be able to deliver 1 of the 2 P0 features-- the feature on your roadmap or the feature on your counterpart’s roadmap. What do you do?
