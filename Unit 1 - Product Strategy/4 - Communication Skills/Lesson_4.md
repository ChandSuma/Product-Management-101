# Listening

Watch [What is Active Listening?](https://youtu.be/G5K3ieYyr5c)

Listening is important! You need to listen in order to understand other perspectives and needs. Listening also builds relationships, promotes understanding, and builds empathy. Additionally, it also helps to save time and make sure things are done right the first time.

<br>

Active listening is:

- More than just listening
- Being an engaged listener
- Fully understanding other points of views
- Not imposing your own views

<br>

Tips for active listening:

- Make eye contact and smile
- Provide encouragement
- Don’t interrupt
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Paraphrase

# Exercise: Active Listening

# Storytelling

Watch [What is storytelling?](https://youtu.be/S52zhLD1Sxo)

PMs are storytellers. Stories allow you to express your vision and thoughts through more compelling, tangible narratives. Storytelling makes it easier for people to understand and relate to what you are explaining.

<br>

The elements of a story are...
 
- `Hero:` 

- `Goal:` 

- `Villain:` 

- `Sidekick:` 

- `Plot:` 

<br>

Watch [How to Build a Story.](https://youtu.be/cjj_mobCAVE)

Key things to keep in mind when building stories:

- Focus on the problem from the hero’s perspective
- Start by writing the ending first
- The more personal and relatable the story, the more memorable it will be, and the more engaged the audience will be.
- Details and specifics make the story feel more real

<br>
<br>

Fill in the following table:

| Element | Definition |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Hero | ? |
| Goal | ? |
| Villain | ? |
| Sidekick | ? |
| Plot | ? |

<br>

<details>
<summary> The solution table is... </summary>

| Element | Definition |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Hero | The main character - your user |
| Goal | What the user is trying to accomplish |
| Villain | The problem that is preventing the user from reaching their goal |
| Sidekick | A companion that helps the hero reach their goal -- your product |
| Plot | A detailed account of how the hero and the sidekick defeat their villain and read their goal |
