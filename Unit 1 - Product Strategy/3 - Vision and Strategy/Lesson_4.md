# Vision

Watch [Vision](https://youtu.be/OsMptnZZr4M).

What is Vision?

Vision describes...

- what your product looks like in its final state
- the essence of your product
- what your product does and why it matters to users

It should be able to be summarized in a sentence or two. For example, Googe Wifi's vision was to create "a wireless access point that people love."

<br>

Vision is more than just a sentence. It needs to tell a compelling story about:

- What you’re building
- Who it’s for
- Why it matters

Leverage the research and insights you've already gathered to do this. It needs to stay high level. 

Vision is incredibly important because will impact every single aspect of your product so it is important to be thoughtful when you are crafting your vision. It also gets the team excited and motivated about building the product, and serves as a "north star" for guiding the team and decision making.

Everything you do should trickle down from your vision, including strategy and features. Because it impacts everything you do, it's important to be thoughtful when crafting the vision.

<br>
<br>

### Creating Vision

Watch [Creating Vision](https://youtu.be/c1GMrMcKIzc).

You’ll want to make sure that your vision is all of the following:

- `Inspiring:` to get the team excited about the product. Focus on the problem you want to solve and why it matters. How will your product change their life?

> "If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you." - Steve Jobs

<br>

- `Ambitious:` think big. It should be broad, open-ended and challenge the team to think about the problem in different ways. This means it isn't too detailed. 

Ambition gives you leeway to change, adapt and pivot the product as you learn new information, while still working towards an overarching goal.

<br>

- `Easy to explain:` people should "get it" and understand it when they hear it. A short, concise sentence or two should cover it. The details matter - but belong elsewhere.

<br>

- `Something the team believes in:` the team has to believe in the vision you're creating by involving them early on. Asking team members to participate in early research and talking with customers can help build belief. You can go through a vision exercise together to co-create the vision too.

<br>

- `Something you evolve over time:` it's really hard to get things exactly right the first time. It's more imporant to take new information into account and evolve or pivot into a new direction.

<br>

- `Something you share out frequently:` everyone on the team needs to always be on the same page. They'll use this vision to setup and inform decision making. Tailoring the way you present it to different groups is also important, based on the things they care about the most.

<br>

Vision serves as a north star to guide the team and decision making as your product is being developed. It explains what you’re building, who it’s for, and why it matters. Vision also gets the team excited and motivated about building the product.

# Strategy

Watch [What is Strategy?](https://youtu.be/VquT7fG7668).

Strategy is how you get to your vision. It's all about how you are going to realize your vision and takes the following things into account:

- `User needs:` Who is your target user? What are their needs that could be solved by this product?

- `Key Features:` What are the key primary features that will solve the user's need? Will these features result in people using the product? Will these features convince people to buy the product?

- `Competitors & Differentiation:` How does your product compare to others in the market? What areas do you want to differentiate in?

- `Business Goals:` What are the business goals of the company and product? It can go beyond revenue. What KPIs can you use to measure these goals?

- `Trends:` How is the market changing? How are user behaviors and needs changing?

<br>
<br>

Watch [Creating Strategy](https://youtu.be/oYskzTOgjCc).

When you create strategy, you want to make sure that it’s:

- `A balance between features, user and market needs, and business goals.` Some features you _could_ build won't meet user or business needs; and some might be too expensive to build.
 
- `Creating building blocks for how to get to your vision.` How can you break your strategy out into 3-5 smaller components to realize your vision? These are things your product needs to get absolutely right.

- `High level, but with a little more detail.` Start filling in things with more detail than your vision contained...but the full details will be in the PRDs.

- `Goal oriented, and preferably measurable.` Goals make things actionable because you know what to do. When you can measure your progress towards meeting them, it's even better.
